- Just like other mammals, humans have a tendency to be xenophobic. Humans have a "us" vs "them" mentality. 
- Humans today however, are in big societies. Our biological instinct is not able to sustain such cooperation networks then how?
- We have overcame it through creating [[imagined order]] and **devising scripts**
- As we learned from [[Chapter 7 - Memory overload]], our memory is unreliable and we need a way to communicate without being limited to the capabilities of our brain. 
- The imagined order is neither evil or good. They can be used to bring equality such as human rights however, it could also be used to build hierarchies; separating them by race, gender, etc...
- Time and time again, people have created imagined orders to separate themselves and creating categories; Whites and Blacks, Women and Men, Rich and Poor. A lot of these separations have gotten better but they still exist for example the cast system in India. 
- If you want to keep any human groups isolated, the best way is to convince everyone that these  people are a source of pollution. It can be seen with Jews, gays, blacks. *Jews are all the root of problems.* *Blacks are dumb and barbaric*. *Gays contract STDs and they are full of sins.
