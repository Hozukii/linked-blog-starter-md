- You do not have a thousand years to live. Urgency is on you. While you live, while you can, **be good** 
- Change: nothing inherently bad in the Process, Nothing inherently good in the result. 
- It is not bad luck that something bad has happened to me. It is good luck that I was able to bear the event. It is a chance to learn and be in control of your soul
