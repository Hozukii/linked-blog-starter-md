# TO BE OR TO DO
#### Chapter summary
- To be or to do?, which will you choose was a question asked by John Boyd. There will come a time where you will have to make a decision between. Will you be captured by the idea of being someone and ideal? or taking action and doing?. We often fall in love with the image of what success feels like but if you are fitting into that image, you are not accomplishing anything. Impressing people is utterly different from being impressive. Ego helps us in this deception
