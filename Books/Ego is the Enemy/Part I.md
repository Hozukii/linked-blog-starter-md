# TO BE OR TO DO
#### Chapter summary
- To be or to do?, which will you choose was a question asked by John Boyd. There will come a time where you will have to make a decision between. Will you be captured by the idea of being someone and ideal? or taking action and doing?.

Impressing people is utterly different from being impressive. Ego helps us in this deception
