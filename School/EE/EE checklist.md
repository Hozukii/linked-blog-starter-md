- Bibliography font 
- *Specify title* 
	- *How does altering the number of blades of a 3D-printed propeller affect its aerodynamic efficiency in a controlled environment?*
- Check for more formal language
### Theoretical framework
- How does not accounting fore blade interaction lead a influence in experimental findings 
- Discuss other models such as CFD
### Methodology
- Expand on uncertainties and limitations
	- especially in 3d printing process
		- explore how roughness, blade shape variation, and material limitations could introduce experimental error
		- suggestions for better methods 
	- battery inconsistencies
### Data collection
- More detailed analysis of the trends observed
	- Why might the changes in thrust and torque balance each other out in terms of efficiency 
	- How the big uncertainty might obscure any potential trends in the data
		- suggest ways to reduce this error 
### Evaluation 
- Elaborate how the identified errors specifically impacted the experimental results.
	- Fore example: How might motor inefficiency have skewed the efficiency measurements
- More concrete suggestions for future 
	- Example: instead of constant power source, recommend a specific equimpent such as laboratory-grade DC power supply 
### Conclusion
- Strengthen the conclusion by linking it back to the broader implications of your findings. 
- How these results might be applied in real-world engineering situations,  such as UAVs or wind turbines 
	- Consider proposing further research,
### Presentation & structure 
- Ensure that all figures are correctly referenced and formatted consistently throught the essay
- minor formatting issues such as:
	- inconsistent spacing around equations
- Check for typographical errors 
### bibliography & Citation
- Some figures are mentioned but lack direct in-text citation. 
- Double check that all sources used in the theoretical sections are cited appropriately in the bibliography 
### Final thoughts & Improvements
- Clary the connection between theory and results 
	- How theoretical limitations might influence the experimental outcomes
- Sterngthen the analysis of uncertainties and erros 
	- how they affect the final resuls and proposing improvements 
- Ensure language remains formal
- figures and image text should be seperated from the main text, this can be done by considering to use italiocs or framing the images
- Make the CAD drawing side by side
- Significant figures and decimal places needs to be accounted for 
	- The uncertainty of your data needs to be the same number of decimal places as the data itself and always round up.
