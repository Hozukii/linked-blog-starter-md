- Hypermesh is used to tackle physics simulations 
- CFD - computational fluid dynamics 

### Propeller slip/ pitch / actual slip / theoretical slip
- each time a screw make a complete turn, it has completed a "pitch"
	- Pitch is the distance the screw travelled during one complete turn 
	- A fluid produces drag against the propeller, so the propeller never actually reaches its full pitch.
- The lost distance of the pitch due to drag is **propeller slip**
**Propeller slip** - The difference between theoretical and the actual distance travelled by the propeller in each rotation - the difference of theoretical and actual speed.

### Blade Element Theory 
Blade Element Theory is a method of predicting the performance of a propeller. The theory analyzes  forces acting on small sections on the blade such as torque or thrust. This theory does not account for tip vortex or the effect of the other propeller. It treats each blade as independent from other blades.

$V_{ax}$ - Axial flow velocity - the velocity of the air that the propeller is experiencing
$V_\theta$ - angular flow velocity - rotational velocity of the propeller
