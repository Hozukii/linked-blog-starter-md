### Blade Element Theory 
Blade Element Theory is a method of predicting the performance of a propeller. The theory analyzes  forces acting on small sections on the blade such as torque or thrust. This theory does not account for tip vortex or the effect of the other propeller. It treats each blade as independent from other blades.
