I initially got the idea from watching a YouTube video. It started off with researching about uneven propellers and its effect on sound but I realized that it was more complex than I initially thought. I went through the process of changing my idea twice. While the extended essay was tough, I was able to enjoy the process as I conducted and built systems which I was interested in. The best part overall was the ability to actualize a system out of ideas through the usueeke of CAD and 3D-printing. While aerodynamics was an aspect I came to dislike t, it made me appreciate and take more interest in engineering as a whole . Through this project my self disciple and grit was improved as there were many times where I wanted to give up. Overall this experience has helped me become efficient and disciplined and helped me build new skills. 

- A very interesting topic. What led to the decision of writing an EE in this particular area of physics?
    
- Were your original plans/ideas realistic and appropriate?
    

Initially watching youtube videos regarding uneven blade patterns and sound. Number of blades and sound. Found after some research that it was an extremely new concept and therefore not much information. Efficiency is a connector.

Also, it did not have a quiet sound room.

  

- What do you think your successes were in this process?
    

Success- grit and perseverance. Numerous times that I wanted to give up due to lack of resources but continued on as it was quite fun and also had the whole summer break to complete. 

Experimental - used simple ideas. More complex would need simulations. 

  

- What was the most rewarding aspect of the entire process?
    

Making the blades using 3D printing. 

  

- How will this experience prepare you for future work of this nature (in college or employment?).
    

Electrical engineering- the CAD aspects will be come into use 

  

- Is there any advice you would want to pass on to someone just starting out on an extended essay?
    

Be efficient and strategic with their choices in terms of interest, resources out there. Lots of preliminary experiments or research before you commit to a choice.

  
  
  

- In retrospect, is there anything you would have done differently?
    

Would not change anything. Spent a lot of time on reading research papers (over 50) and only used a few.

  

- In what ways do you think you have grown as a learner through this process?
    

Learning skills- got better at time management (outside of school). Always been an independent learner. This process allowed further development of this (collaboration) 

  

- Did you find using a Research and Reflection Space (journal) useful?
    

Did not find them useful and has not reread them therefore was not useful for this individual.  At the point when I had written the reflection I already knew what to do. Was reflecting throughout the whole process, not just at these particular points.

- Is writing an EE for you mainly about process or product?
    

The process as provided the student with an excuse to delve into something of interest deeper. The writing was the afterthought.
