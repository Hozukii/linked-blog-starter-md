Research question: How does altering the number of blades of a propeller affects its efficiency?
### Introduction
Aerodynamics is the branch of physics and engineering that studies the behaviour of air and fluids in motion, particularly their interaction with solid objects such as aircrafts, propellers, and vehicles. It helps understand concepts such as drag, lift, and thrust. Its principles are applied across various fields, from the aviation industry, sports and architecture to help optimize performance and efficiency. Within aerodynamics, the topic I was most interested in understanding was propellers as they can be used in everyday tools such as hair dryers to UAVs.
Propellers are used in many things from aircrafts to computer cooling and there are countless amount of different propeller designs that are in use today. I have always been interested in engineering and product design therefore I often keep an eye for design choices that engineers and designers make in their products. As I take a look at many tools and products, I was curious as to why there are so many different propeller designs even for things that seemingly achieve the same purpose. In hopes of getting closer to that answer, I decided to particularly observe the effect of the number of blades on propeller efficiency. Thus my research question is: How does altering the number of blades of a propeller affects its efficiency?
