# Script
- Literary work - Little red cap by Carol Ann Duffy
- Non-literary Work - Tron:Legacy by Joseph Kosinski under Disney

Today in this individual oral, I would like to talk the global issue of gender, but more specifically, how the stereotypical representation of women as submissive and innocent created by the media and reflected in society leads to imbalance of relationship dynamics, and I'm going to explore this through 2 works. 
The first work is a poem called "Little red cap" by Carol Ann Duffy from her 1999 collection  "The World's wife". Even from the title it's evident that it's a reference to little red riding hood which is a old tale about a innocent young girl being tricked and eaten by a wolf. 
The second work I chose is a science fiction film by Disney called "Tron Legacy" in which the protagonist travels into a digital world, there he meets the deuteragonist of film a women shaped computer algorithm who acts as love interest in the romantic subplot. 
Both works show how stereotypical portrayal of women leads to imbalances in relationship dynamics.
