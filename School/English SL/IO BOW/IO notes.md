# Script
- Literary work - Little red cap by Carol Ann Duffy
- Non-literary Work - Tron:Legacy by Joseph Kosinski under Disney

Today in this individual oral, I would like to talk the global issue of gender, but more specifically, how the stereotypical representation of women as submissive and innocent created by the media and reflected in society leads to imbalance of relationship dynamics, and I'm going to explore this through 2 works. 
The first work is science fiction film by Disney called "Tron Legacy" in which the protagonist travels into a digital world, there he meets the deuteragonist of film a women shaped computer algorithm who acts as love interest in the romantic subplot. 
The second work I chose is a a poem called "Little red cap" by Carol Ann Duffy from her 1999 collection  "The World's wife". Even from the title it's evident that it's a reference to little red riding hood which is a old tale about a innocent young girl being tricked and eaten by a wolf. 
Both works show how stereotypical portrayal of women leads to imbalances in relationship dynamics.

First looking at "The world's wife" collection by Duffy, the poems references many western tales and mythologies seen in works like "Little red cap" and "Pygmalion's bride". By alluding these famous stories that the audience are familiar with, she challenges and highlights the issues in the story and society as a whole. For example, in "Pygmalion's bride". The original story of Pygmalion is that he builds the perfect female sculpture. but Duffy personifies the sculpture allowing her to highlight the lack of power women have in their relationships and that they are expected to do what the man wants, by acting submissive and not opposing like a statue. Now Looking at "Little red cap", she alludes to "Little red riding hood" a classic story of predator and prey. In her poem, the protagonist is the innocent little girl and the older man is the wolf where the little girl is sexually engaged with the older man. However, Duffy writes the poem from the first person perspective of the young girl in order to express her inner thoughts breaking the image of being innocent.  Yet, she still acts innocent in order to develop the relationship with the man. 
Through allusion to little riding hood, and telling the story through the lens of the protagonist, Duffy highlights how women are restricted in their self-expression due to societal stereotypes told in many stories which then consequently creates a imbalance in power dynamics in the relationship.


Extract:
Now looking into extracts in  17 to 18, Duffy uses imagery as a way to communicate the physical difference in power in relationships. "My stockings ripped to shreds, scraps of red from my blazer. Snagged on twig and branch, murder clues. I lost both shoes".  Duffy purposely leaves out  subject-verbs in order to humanize the old man emphasizing the allusion between the man and the wolf. Thus, the reader is inclined to image a more violent scene as the wolf ravages the girl. Duffy also uses parataxis, jjj communicates the intensity of the events as well as conveying that these are commands or orders which she must abide by. Overall, the use of imagery, lack of subject-verbs, and parataxis illustrates the difference in physical power in the relationship. 

Moving on to line 14 to 15, Duffy states "The wolf, I knew, would lead me deep into the wood, Away from home, to a dark tangled thorny place". The allusion to "little red riding hood" more specifically to how the little girl was lured into the forest and later eaten is a symbol for how women are seen as easy target to manipulate and exploit because of the stereotype built throughout time, as innocent. This leads men to believe that they should hold more power over the women in the relationship leading to imbalances in power dynamics. However, use of caesura, the short but powerful "I knew" in the line make it clear to the audience that Duffy is challenging the stereotype, by not victimizing the speaker, and the audience understands that she is not the one being exploited but the opposite is true. 

She further challenges the balance in power dynamics in the last stanza through line 37 to 38. She writes, "To a willow to see how it wept. I took an axe to a salmon. To see how it leapt. I took an axe to the wolf". Through the use of parallelism, "I took an axe to a salmon" and "I took an axe to the wolf", Duffy emphasizes the gain of power throughout the relationship. While the speaker has throughout the poem made her intentions clear, this is an critical moment since for the first time, she takes external action explicitly exercising her power in the relationship.

Moving to my non-literary work, the Sci-fi "Tron: legacy" is a prime example of the stereotypical representation of a women that are seen in films especially in science fiction films as they are often directed by men and consequently their desires. While the film takes place in virtual world, where the rules of society are different from that of Earth, gender roles are still prevalent throughout the film. Every woman in the film with the exception of  the deuteragonist who is also the love interest to the protagonist, are essentially servants or secretaries to male "shaped" algorithm. As these are roles that forces the women to submit towards their superior pushing the notion that men should be in a higher authority than women. The audience, impressionable young men, are led to believe that an unbalanced power dynamics in relationships are natural as those are the type of relationships seen in media. Additionally, even for the exception, the deuteragonist , the stereotype still plagues her character. She is physically strong, however she is mentally innocent and naive. The film employs the setting to justify her character. As she is an algorithm in a shape of a mature woman, certain physical and mental attributes can be developed while some can remain undeveloped. At times, she is essentially a little girl in a body of a young woman. 
The childish demeanor of hers can particularly be seen in the first extract.  The first screenshot shows the deuteragonist , and the protagonist in the scene. In the scene, she eagerly asks a question to the protagonist, who responds with a distracted and indifferent answer. Although hard to see from the screenshot, the women is hugging the book like a child. Looking at the composition, the protagonist is placed in the forefront while the woman is placed in the background behind the protagonist. The composition places more importance on the protagonist over the woman even when she is the one talking. Additionally, guiding lines in the form of led lights are used in the scene guiding the eyes of the audience to notice the difference in importance. Her childish personality at times leads there to be a difference in dynamics between the two characters. 

The power dynamics between the two is obvious when screenshot 2 and 3 is contrasted. In the second screenshot, the woman takes up the composition of the shot widening her arms while the man stand behind.  Their body positions are quite similar as both stand upright and their height are matched. So although the woman might be covering the protagonist from danger, the audience understands that they are quite equally matched in power since one is not put down against the other. Comparing screeshot 2 to 3 however, the
