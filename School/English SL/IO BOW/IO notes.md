# Script
- Literary work - Little red cap by Carol Ann Duffy
- Non-literary Work - Tron:Legacy by Joseph Kosinski under Disney

Today in this individual oral, I would like to talk the global issue of gender, but more specifically, how the stereotypical representation of women as submissive and innocent created by the media and reflected in society leads to imbalance of relationship dynamics, and I'm going to explore this through 2 works. 
The first work is science fiction film by Disney called "Tron Legacy" in which the protagonist travels into a digital world, there he meets the deuteragonist of film a women shaped computer algorithm who acts as love interest in the romantic subplot. 
The second work I chose is a a poem called "Little red cap" by Carol Ann Duffy from her 1999 collection  "The World's wife". Even from the title it's evident that it's a reference to little red riding hood which is a old tale about a innocent young girl being tricked and eaten by a wolf. 
Both works show how stereotypical portrayal of women leads to imbalances in relationship dynamics.

First looking at "The world's wife" collection by Duffy, the poems references many western tales and mythologies seen in works like "Little red cap" and "Pygmalion's bride". By alluding these famous stories that the audience are familiar with, she challenges and highlights the issues in the story and society as a whole. For example, in "Pygmalion's bride". The original story of Pygmalion is that he builds the perfect female sculpture. but Duffy personifies the sculpture allowing her to highlight the lack of power women have in their relationships and that they are expected to do what the man wants, by acting submissive and not opposing like a statue. Now Looking at "Little red cap", she alludes to "Little red riding hood" a classic story of predator and prey. In her poem, the protagonist is the innocent little girl and the older man is the wolf where the little girl is sexually engaged with the older man. However, Duffy writes the poem from the first person perspective of the young girl in order to express her inner thoughts breaking the image of being innocent.  Yet, she still acts innocent in order to develop the relationship with the man. 
Through allusion to little riding hood, and telling the story through the lens of the protagonist, Duffy highlights how women are restricted in their self-expression due to societal stereotypes told in many stories which then consequently creates a imbalance in power dynamics in the relationship.


Extract:


Now looking into extracts in line 14 to 15, Duffy states "The wolf, I knew, would lead me deep into the wood, Away from home, to a dark tangled thorny place". The allusion to "little red riding hood" more specifically to how the little girl was lured into the forest and later eaten is a symbol for how women are seen as easy target to manipulate and exploit because of the stereotype built throughout time, as innocent. This leads men to believe that they should hold more power over the women in the relationship leading to imbalances in power dynamics. However, use of caesura, the short but powerful "I knew" in the line make it clear to the audience that Duffy is challenging the stereotype, by not victimizing the speaker, and the audience understands that she is not the one being exploited but the opposite is true. 
Moving on to line 17 to 18, Duffy uses imagery as a way to communicate the physical difference in power in relationships. "My stockings ripped to shreds, scraps of red from my blazer. Snagged on twig and branch, murder clues. I lost both shoes".  Duffy purposely leaves out  subject-verbs in order to humanize the old man emphasizing the allusion between the man and the wolf. Thus, the reader is inclined to image a more violent scene as the wolf ravages the girl. Duffy also uses parataxis, communicates the intensity of the events as well as conveying that these are commands or orders which she must abide by. Overall, the use of imagery, lack of subject-verbs, and parataxis illustrates the difference in physical power in the relationship.
