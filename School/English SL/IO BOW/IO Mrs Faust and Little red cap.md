Global issue:

The stereotypical and non-diverse representation of women created by the media and society leads to lack of opportunities for women to self-express leading to unbalanced power dynamics in relationships.

For my individual oral in english IB, I want to explore idea of:
the stereotypical and homogenous representation of women created by the media and society which leads to women in relationships being confined to act a certain way which is often in a submissive and innocent way which leads to unfair power dynamics in relationships. 
This is in the context of the poem little red-cap and Pygmalion's Bride by Carol Ann Duffy
make it coherent into a global issue
