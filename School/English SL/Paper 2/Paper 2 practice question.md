In Born a Crime by Trevor Noah, foreshadowing is strategically woven through reflective commentary and narrative structure to underscore the precariousness of life under apartheid. One key authorial choice is Noah’s use of anecdotes about his mother’s unyielding faith and pragmatism, which subtly hint at her later survival. For instance, early chapters detail her insistence on attending multiple churches, described humorously as a "tour of hope," which establishes her resilience. This foreshadows her miraculous survival in the shooting incident, where her relentless optimism and quick thinking save her life. The effect is twofold: it creates suspense by embedding a sense of impending danger in seemingly mundane routines and reinforces the theme of maternal strength as a counterforce to systemic violence. Noah’s juxtaposition of humor with grave realities amplifies the emotional impact, as readers recognize the foreshadowed trauma only in retrospect, mirroring the unpredictability of apartheid’s brutality.
