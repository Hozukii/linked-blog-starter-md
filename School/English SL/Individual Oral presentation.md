## analysis of poem 
- "spools of suffering set out in ordered rows" 
	- ordered rows is a objectification of the concept of suffering into a 
- A hundred agonies in black and white
	- Suffering and atrocities are reduced to simple photographs for the sake of commodification.
	- The reduction into simple photographs strips the complexity of the situation. 
- editor will pick out five or six for Sunday’s supplement
	- Instead of showing the hundreds of pictures, the editors reduces only to a few which will have the most engagement for the sake of attention. 
- The reader’s eyeballs prick with tears between the bath and pre-lunch beers
	- The moments where these images are consumed are between times of insignificance such as between the "bath" and "pre-lunch beers"
	- Irony between the gravitas of the article and images and the moments  that the readers are deciding to read them. 
	- Instead of spreading awareness about wars in a important manner instead they are treated as nothing more than entertainment for killing time. 
- "He has a job to do"
	- Tone: detached
	- The moral dilemma is not of concern as it is a just it's something he must do regardless. 
## commentary on the analysis of poem 
- Suffering are sold as products for the public to consume. 
- Are the reduction and commodification of suffering justified to spread awareness? 
- The poem also highlights how the commercialisation of war and human suffering does not lead to awareness but instead leads to a source of entertainment and it loses its importance. 
## analysis of the photograph
- There are prominent figures in the photograph
- The difference in power dynamic firstly with the body language and composition.
	- The man on the left takes up majority of the image. 
	- His body is dynamic and spread out freely able to move.
