#### Description / quotes
Trevor Noah's mom explains that the "black tax" is the heavy financial and emotional burden placed on black families as previous generations were deprived of resources.
"My mother calls it “the black tax.” Because the generations who came before you have been pillaged, rather than being free to use your skills and education to move forward, you lose everything just trying to bring everyone behind you back up to zero"
"My mother’s greatest fear was that I would end up paying the black tax, that I would get trapped by the cycle of poverty and violence that came before me. She had always promised me that I would be the one to break that cycle"

Reflecting back onto the talk about the black tax shows how the trauma of the generational cycle of poverty is past down through her mom to him even in a life or death situation. It shows how the trauma sticks through generations and financial and culture that is ingrained to question life or money.
