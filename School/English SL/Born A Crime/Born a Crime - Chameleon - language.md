#### Description / quote
He explains that language is a tool to fit in and to survive. 
"They looked shocked for a moment, and then they started laughing. “Oh, sorry, dude. We thought you were something else. We weren’t trying to take anything from you. We were trying to steal from white people. Have a good day, man.”  "That, and so many other smaller incidents in my life, made me realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people." 
"I became a chameleon. My color didn’t change, but I could change your perception of my color"
"If you spoke to me in Zulu, I replied to you in Zulu. If you spoke to me in Tswana, I replied to you in Tswana. Maybe I didn’t look like you, but if I spoke like you, I was you."
