"As I understand that people were different colors, but in my head white and black and brown were like types of chocolates"

" But we were all just chocolate. I didn’t know any of it had anything to do with “race.” I didn’t know what race was."
"So when the other kids in Soweto called me “white,” even though I was light brown, I just thought they had their colors mixed up, like they hadn’t learned them properly. “Ah, yes, my friend. You’ve confused aqua with turquoise. I can see how you made that mistake. You’re not the first.”"
