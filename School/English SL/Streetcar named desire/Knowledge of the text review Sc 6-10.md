**## Knowledge of the text review Sc 6-10

  

Scene 6

1.  The way Williams portrays an atmosphere of tiredness and depression at the beginning of this scene (include analysis of stage directions here, and form a contrast between the atmosphere presented here and the optimism at the end of Scene 5).  Why do you think the date between Mitch and Blanche has gone badly?
    

  

2.       Contrast how Blanche and Mitch present themselves to their ‘date’.

  How does Blanche create the impression of her intellectual and cultural superiority over Mitch?  Why does she do this, and what significance can you find in her use of French?

 Look at Mitch's response, with its emphasis on the way he 'perspire[s]' and his pride in his physique.  How adequate is this as a response to Blanche's cultural affectation previously?

  

3.  The scene finishes with Mitch and Blanche very close emotionally.  Why do we feel then that this optimistic ending is built on very shaky foundations?

  
  

Scene 7

1.         This scene is predominantly concerned with the conversation between Stanley and Stella regarding Blanche's 'history' in Laurel, yet we are constantly reminded of Blanche's presence in the bathroom (and her good mood - she is expecting Mitch at her birthday party).  Is there poignancy in Blanche's uplifted spirits as a backdrop to Stanley's revelations about her morally suspect past?  What effect is created by using the birthday party preparation as a backdrop to these revelations?

  

2.  Look at Stella's defence of Blanche.  Though this would clearly have little effect on Stanley's perception of Blanche, does it affect the way the audience views his revelations (particularly after Blanche's discussions of Allen Grey with Mitch in the previous scene)?
    

  

3.  What does Stanley mean when he says: 'Her [Blanche's] future is mapped out for her'?
    

  
  
  
  

Scene 8

1. Look at the atmosphere created at the beginning of the scene.  It is a 'dismal birthday supper'.  How does Williams create the effect of tension hiding thinly beneath a veneer of assumed joviality?


2. Stella (fairly uncharacteristically?) attacks Stanley for 'making a pig of himself'.  Why do you think she does this?  Is there a link between the language she uses and the animal imagery that Blanche has previously employed to describe Stanley?  Does this explain the violence of his reaction?

3. Look closely at Stanley's speech, 'That's how I'll clear the table!'  In some detail, show how Stanley's use of language reveals not only aspects of his character, but also the nature of his battle against Blanche for possession of Stella.

4. The scene finishes with Stella (Blanche's only protection against Stanley) being taken to hospital.  Blanche's isolation is accentuated.  Consider the significance of the Varsouviana, the music rising 'with sinister rapidity', Blanche 'twisting a washcloth' and the light fading 'slowly'.
    

  

Scene 9

1. The opening stage directions stress 'the sense of disaster closing in' on Blanche.  How is this done? Look at Blanche's posturing and clothing, and the use of props and music. Look at the description of Blanche's actions when Mitch rings (in particular look at the verbs in the stage directions).  What does this tell us about Blanche's state of mind and her hopes for Mitch?  How are we, as the audience, expected to feel?

  Feeling of eerie somber. The use of liquor and bedroom clothes highlights her lack of effort to present herself as she usually do. 

2.   How useful is Blanche's comment: 'I don't want the truth. I tell what ought to be the truth') to an understanding of her character? Blanche's resistance and her defensiveness collapses.  She suddenly reveals the 'truth' (more than Mitch could reasonably expect!)  Does her 'confession' throw a different light on her?  What reaction is expected from the audience? Look at the significance of the Mexican flower seller, Blanche's response ('as if to herself') and her statement that the 'opposite' of death is 'desire'.

  

3.    When Blanche acts the cultured woman, she entices Mitch.  When she is open, honest and vulnerable, he rejects her.  Discuss the ending of the scene.  Bearing in mind that Mitch is demanding sex and that Blanche has always succumbed to sexual advances as a way of attempting to gain protection, why is Mitch's treatment of her here such a bitter blow to Blanche?  How does this explain the violence of her outburst at the end of the scene?

  
  
  

Scene 10

1.   How is Blanche's frame of mind portrayed at the opening of this scene?  Look at what she wears, as well as what she says.  Note in particular, the smashing of the hand mirror. Stanley's clothing is also important in this scene (as it is throughout the play for both he and Blanche) - he moves from silk bowling shirt to silk pyjamas.  Link this to previous remarks about Stanley as a 'richly feathered male bird among hens'.

  

2.      Look at Blanche's comments on herself.  Does this throw light on... a) her attitude towards ageing? And… b) her grip on reality?  Look also at her story of Mitch returning with a box of roses. Stanley brutally shatters Blanche's delusions.  How is language used as a weapon by Stanley?

  

3.     The stage directions leading to Blanche's rape are extremely important in establishing atmosphere and mood.  Key words here are: 'lurid', 'menacing', 'inhuman', 'jungle', 'flames', etc.  How is the effect created in this very visual part of the play?  Sounds are also important as is the 'slice of life' depicted in the rather grim and sordid glimpse of New Orleans life on the streets.**
