Shakshuka is a food originating from North Africa. The main ingredients are tomatoes and eggs. I have made it before in the past, and I really love it. It's a dish that I discovered thanks to the internet because I have never seen any restaurants serving it. It's probably because it's more of a home dish. Instead of the usual spices used, I tried using Garam masala. Additionally, I added a Chinese chili oil which went really well more than I expected.

Now, I feel like I have gotten use to cooking vegetarian food. With this dish eggs are the main source of protein. Also, I decided to not eat any carbs with it because of the things I ate in the morning and the fact that the portion was pretty big. The unexpected difficulties with this whole cas has been the portions. I usually cook when I am alone and making a dish for one person has been hard to measure.
