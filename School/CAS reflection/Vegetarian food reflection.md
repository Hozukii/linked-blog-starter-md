This will be the last reflection for this CAS project. The latest meal that I cooked was Japanese style curry using vegetarian sausage. My mom is not fully vegetarian but she doesn't really much meat so we often try out different substitutions for meat. One of the best substitutions so far has been vegetarian sausages made by IKEA. I think the important thing with cooking vegetarian food that people often miss is that you are not trying to imitate meat because then it will never be better than meat. It's important that substitutions are truly its own thing. The aspect of the IKEA sausages I enjoy is that they don't try to imitate the taste of meat but it tries to imitate the shape and the protein content.  


This whole CAS project has really been interesting to me. I'm definitely not going to become vegetarian however, I don't mind eating and cooking vegetarian food once in a while. The biggest takeaway that I have taken away from this is how to substitute meat without losing the protein content. It's not like I really love meat but I used to think that eating enough protein with meat was quite difficult but through this project this mindset has somewhat changed and it has at least been loosened.
