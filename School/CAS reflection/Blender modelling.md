I have been doing blender at least once a week. However, I have been busy with other stuff to write any reflections on it. This week I started a new project / work so I decided that I'm going to document my progress. I'm thinking of recreating a photograph I saw of a woman in a train taken with a fisheye lens. I'm confident in my ability to model inorganic shapes such as the train, screen, seats but I wanted to also challenge myself with this project by modelling and simulating organic shapes such as clothing, bags, accessories, and etc. I feel like I have grown a bit too comfortable in recent times with blender not stepping out of my strong points so I hope that this one will push me to new heights. Another aspect that is going to be challenging is the texturing, when I'm trying to achieve somewhat a photorealistic results, it's really important to have good looking textures. I would even say that texturing is 50% of the artwork, the other 50% is modelling. I hope to finish this project in a month or two
