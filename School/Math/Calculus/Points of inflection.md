- Points of inflection are points at which a given curve changes its concavity
- Now given that there is  a point of inflection at x=a (which is differentiable) then:
	- $f''(a) = 0$
	- the sign of $f''(x)$ changes at x =a
	- Also if both are satisfied and $f'(a) = a$ then we have a stationary inflection
	- Otherwise the inflection point is non-stationary
