As an example
$$f(x) = \dfrac{5x + x^2}{x}, x \ne 0$$

### Definition
**Limit of a function** - if $f(x)$ can be made as close as we like to some real number L by making x sufficiently close to (but not equal to) a, then we say that $f(x)$ has a *limit* of $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$, and we write:
$$\lim_{x \to a}f(x) = L$$
in this case, we say $f(x)$ converges to L as $x$ approaches $a$A

- It may have a limit withouh being defined
