# Simple & General sine functions
- Sine is periodic $f(x) = sin(x)$ has period $2\pi = 360\degree$
- Domain: $(-\infty,\infty)$ Range: $[-1,1]$

- $y = sin(x)$ is *stretched* vertically by scale factor 2

- Reflection in the x-axis

---
- Stretched horizontally by scale factor 0.5

- Range stays the same but the period now becomes $\pi$
---
- Horizontal translation by 1u to the right

- vertical translation by 1 unit down ![[Pasted image 20231202162829.png]]
## General function 
![[Pasted image 20231202162914.png]]
### Crucial stpes for fitting data $f(x) = asin[b(x-c)]+d$
- Calculate the amplitude: $a = \dfrac {\text{Maximum Value - Minimum value}} 2$
- Vertical shift: $d = \dfrac {\text{Max value + min value}}2$
- constant b: $\dfrac {2\pi} {period}$
# Simple & General Cosine Function
- Very convenient to obtain the graph $f(x) = cosx$
- $cos(x) = sin(x + \dfrac \pi 2$) which implies function is obtained through horizontal translation by $\dfrac \pi 2$ to the left

- **The general form of the cosine function is the same as the sine function**
# Simple & General Tangent Function
- $tan(x) = \dfrac{sin(x)}{cos(x)}$ which means that $tan(x)$ will be undefined at $cos(x) = 0$, which implies vertical asymptotes
- period: $\pi$ 
- range: $(-\infty, \infty)$
- Vertical asymptotes occur at $x = \dfrac \pi 2$
## General form $y = a Tan[b(x-c)] + d, a \neq 0, b>0$
- Principle axis: $y = d$ 
- period: $\dfrac \pi b$
- Amplitude is undefined 
- Infinitely many vertical asymptotes
