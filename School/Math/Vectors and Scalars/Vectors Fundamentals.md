**Vectors** - Quantities that have wo parameters *direction* and *magnitude*
**Displacement vectors** - vectors that are represented by particular directed line segments denoted as $\overrightarrow{AB}$ where $A$ is called the **initial** point and the $B$ is called the **terminal point**

>[!note] Opposite vectors
>Note that $\overrightarrow{AB}$ is not the same as vector $\overrightarrow{BA}$
>- These two have the same length but the opposite direction called opposite vectors
>$\overrightarrow {BA} = -\overrightarrow{AB}$

$\overrightarrow {OA} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \end{pmatrix}$
$\overrightarrow {OB} =  \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}$
