If the events A and B are independent, prove that the event $A$ and $B'$ are independent too
If the events $A$ and $B$ are independent prove that:
$$P(A \cup B) = 1 - P(A') \cdot P(B')$$

Mario rolls a fair six-sided die three times. Calculate the probability that he gets a 6 at least two times
ans: $\dfrac 2 {27}$

A container holds 3 red, 7 white, and 2 black balls. A ball is chosen at random from the container and is not replaced. A second ball is then chosen. Find the probability of choosing one white and one black ball in any order. 
ans: $\dfrac 7 {33}$

During winter, Fiona attends weekly business meetings in Stockholm and always travels to these meetings by car. The probability of being dry, raining or snowing during her travel to these meetings are $\dfrac 12$ , $\dfrac 13$, and $\dfrac 16$ , respectively. The respective probabilities of Fiona arriving on time when it is dry, raining or snowing are $\dfrac 45$, $\dfrac 25$, and $\dfrac 1 {10}$. Given that Fiona arrived late for he meeting last week , find the probability that it was raining that week. 
ans: $\dfrac 49$

A new blood test has been shown to be effective in the early detection of a disease. The probability that the blood test correctly identifies someone with this disease is 0.99, and the probability that the blood test correctly identifies someone without this disease is 0.95. The incidence of this disease in the general population is 0.0001. A doctor administered the blood test to a patient and the test result indicated that this patient had the disease. What is the probability that the patient in fact has this disease?
ans: $\approx 0.00198$
