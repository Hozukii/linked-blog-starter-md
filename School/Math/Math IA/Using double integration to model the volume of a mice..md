### Why it's relevant 
- I like modelling objects. While I usually model through the use of quad meshes I think modelling objects with other methods could spark new ideas or appreciate the modern techniques of modelling objects  - personal engagement
- With my interest in technology and design, I think that knowing the volume of a certain mouse shape could be interesting. Its application can be seen in estimating the amount of volume a mouse has in order to fit a certain amount of sensors and battery.
### What is to be done  
- By using double integration and slicing the mouse into different sections, since the mouse is flat on the bottom of the mouse, a approximate model for the mouse can be found in order to model and calculate the volume of the mouse. 
### What needs to be done. 
- How to choose the interpolation points
	- Chebyshev's nodes
### Lagrange Interpolation
- Used when we have multiple points and we need to fit a curve within those curves 
- Make a polynomial which is zero at every point except the desired coordinate
- Repeat for all points 
- Then add together
