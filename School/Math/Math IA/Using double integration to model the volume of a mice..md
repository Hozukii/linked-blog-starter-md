### Why it's relevant 
- I like modelling objects. While I usually model through the use of quad meshes I think modelling objects with other methods could spark new ideas or appreciate the modern techniques of modelling objects  - personal engagement
- With my interest in technology and design, I think that knowing the volume of a certain mouse shape could be interesting. Its application can be seen in estimating the amount of volume a mouse has in order to fit a certain amount of sensors and battery.
### What is to be done  
- By using double integration and slicing the mouse into different sections, since the mouse is flat on the bottom of the mouse, a approximate model for the mouse can be found in order to model and calculate the volume of the mouse. 
### What needs to be done. 
- Learn about double integration and the method
- Find how to find curves that fits the curves of the mouse .
