Lagrange interpolation also known as Lagrange polynomial is used to create a polynomial function  $P(x)$ of degree $(n-1)$ that passes through n points. 


The general formula is given by :
$$ P(x) = \sum^n_{j=1} P_j (x)$$
where
$$P_j (x) = y_j  \prod^i_{\begin{matrix} x \\ y \end{matrix}}$$
**actually write the eq**
