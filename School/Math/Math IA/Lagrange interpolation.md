Lagrange interpolation also known as Lagrange polynomial is used to create a polynomial function  $P(x)$ of degree $(n-1)$ that passes through n points. 


The general formula is given by :
$$ P(x) = \sum^n_{j=1} P_j (x)$$
where
$$P_j (x) = y_j  \prod^n_{\begin{matrix} k=1 \\ k \neq j  \end{matrix}} \dfrac {x-x_k}{x_j - x_k}$$
**actually write the eq**
