Images of the mouse will be taken from the front, side, and top view which is used to collect data points along the curve of the mouse. The data points will be used to create Lagrange polynomial that approximates the curves of the mouse from the front, side, and top view. To accurately calculate the volume of the mouse, the shape is divided into sections. The curves from the side view and the front view are combined to create a multivariable function which approximates the curvature of the mouse in 3 dimensions. By double integrating the multivariable functions with defined bounds determined from the top view using Lagrange interpolation, the volume of the mouse can be found.
