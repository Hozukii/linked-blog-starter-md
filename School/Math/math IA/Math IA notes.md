Facility location problem 
p-median problem 
## Spatial optimization ingredients
- Objective function 
- decision variables
- constraints
### Decision variables
$$x_i \begin{cases} 1 \ \text{if we open at i} \\ 0 \ \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
### Objective function
Maximisation / minimization / combination of both 
For example for minimizing cost we would look at
$$\sum_{i} x_i$$
Subject to:
$$\sum_i x_i \leq 3$$

### Guideline
Creating a function line of population density 
Then using the "MCLP models"
