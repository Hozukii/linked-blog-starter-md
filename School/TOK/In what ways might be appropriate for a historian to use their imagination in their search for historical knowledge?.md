Imagination is the method of creating new knowledge through interpretation. Historians might use their imagination to translate certain words into the modern language of choice. Many subjective words might not have a direct translation. For example, the ancient wonders of the world were described using words that are subjective. It is the job of the historians to interpret subjective terms  such as beautiful, lavish, etc... The historians are responsible to imagine what the historians meant by certain words based on their other works and historical context.
