The Imola plan is a map drawn by Leonardo da Vinci depicting the city of Imola in Italy. The map was tasked to Leonardo for militaristic use. He used various tools and techniques in order to make an accurate bird eye view of the city. Even today, the map is accurate enough to navigate through the city (“Leonardo da Vinci's Imola Plan changed mapping from art to science”)

Before Leonardo, maps were not as accurate. Cartographers of the time prioritised aesthetics over accuracy depicting mythical creatures and 3 dimensional perspective contrary to the satellite view of the Imola plan. The Imola plan is considered to be one of the first “ichnographic” maps. (Edwards).  The map shows a shift in the purpose of a map from artistic to practical use. In the present day, we would consider the Imola plan as an improvement over the older less accurate maps before Leonardo however, that is only because our idea of what a map should be have been changed. Evaluating the map from an artistic perspective, the map is less grand and stylistic than the maps before it.  Depending on who you ask, they might think that the Imola map is worse than previous maps. However, in this case, the acquisition of new knowledge doesn’t change our old knowledge. It is safe to assume that having more knowledge is better than having less. In that sense, we still have an improvement in knowledge. 

What we consider an improvement of knowledge is hugely dependent on the general consensus of the society at the time. Different perspectives can change what an improvement means. Some can consider new knowledge as an improvement while some might see it as a regression upon past knowledge.
