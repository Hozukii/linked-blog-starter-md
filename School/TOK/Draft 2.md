In 1867, Joseph Lister published a paper named "Antiseptic Principle of the Practice of Surgery"(ingentaconnect). The paper promotes the usage of carbonic acid in order to reduce infections and inflammations. Lister's principles of surgery reduced mortality rates of major operations from 40% down to 3% by 1910 (kcl). The object is relevant to the exhibition because the object shows how the improvement of knowledge can be measured through its results. 

With numerous experimentation and past knowledge of germ theory, he was able to discover ways in which infections can be prevented. The two most major things he implemented was the use of antiseptics and surgical tools. From 1865 to 1869, the mortality rate caused by surgeries in his ward went from almost half of the patients to a mere 15%.  One of the ways an improvement in knowledge can be seen is through its resultant data. After Lister and his publication of his knowledge, there is a correlation between his knowledge and the success rate of surgeries. Such dramatic change in mortality rate are clear evidence that his knowledge was able to reduce mortality rate. In the present day, the construction of knowledge from past knowledge has allowed the mortality rate of surgeries to go below 1%. Lister's publication of his knowledge is a clear example of how the improvement of knowledge can be measured through empirical data.

The Imola plan is a map drawn by Leonardo da Vinci depicting the city of Imola in Italy. The map was tasked to Leonardo for militaristic use. He used various tools and techniques in order to make an accurate bird eye view of the city. Even today, the map is accurate enough to navigate through the city (“Leonardo da Vinci's Imola Plan changed mapping from art to science”) The Imola plan is important to the exhibition since the map signifies that improvement of knowledge can be argued depending on the values and priorities of the society. 

Before Leonardo, maps were not as accurate. Cartographers of the time prioritised aesthetics over accuracy depicting mythical creatures and 3 dimensional perspective contrary to the satellite view of the Imola plan. The Imola plan is considered to be one of the first “ichnographic” maps. (Edwards). Maps during his time were mostly illustrated for educational purposes. Using maps for religious purposes, differences in climate, or mythology. Thus, such maps did not require pinpoint accuracy with many maps having mythical creatures, religious imagery and more. The Imola plan on the other hand is illustrated for navigation and accuracy with the purpose of portraying reality. The map shows a shift in the purpose of a map from artistic and educational to practical and navigational use. In the present day, we would consider the Imola plan as an improvement over the older less accurate maps before Leonardo however, that is only because our idea of what a map should be have been changed. Evaluating the map from an artistic perspective, the map is less grand and stylistic than the maps before it.  Depending on who you ask, they might think that the Imola map is worse than previous maps. However, in this case, the acquisition of new knowledge doesn’t change our old knowledge. It is safe to assume that having more knowledge is better than having less. In that sense, we still have an improvement in knowledge. 

What we consider an improvement of knowledge is hugely dependent on the general consensus of the society at the time. Different perspectives can change what an improvement means. Some can consider new knowledge as an improvement while some might see it as a regression upon past knowledge
