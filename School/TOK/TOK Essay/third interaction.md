After handing in my final draft for my TOK essay, I have received some helpful feedback especially, how clarity was missing for the art portion of my essay. I think clarity in my own thinking is also lacking in addition to the clarity of my writing. I could improve both. I could also delve deeper into some of the topics that I have stated. Sometimes I wrote statements without evidence.Most of the other things were just simple oversight of spelling or sentence structure.
