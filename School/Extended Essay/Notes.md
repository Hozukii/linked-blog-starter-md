- There are kinds of noise with fans:
	- **Aerodynamic noise** - noise due to the interaction of the airflow with the impeller and the fixed components of the fan. 
	- **Electromagnetic noise** - Noise of the electric motor that drives the fan. (mostly caused by the mechanical excitation of the stator by the magnetic field in the air gap between the rotor and the stator)
	- **Mechanical noise** - noise of the bearings and transmission systems 
- Electromagnetic and mechanical noise may become non-negligible at low rotation speed (below 500 to 1000rpm)
## Aerodynamic noise
- Depends on parameters such as
	- geometry of the fan
	- impeller diameter 
	- rotational speed
	- fan operating point 
	- connection of the fan to the ductworks
- A typical fan noise frequency spectrum is made up of tones at multiples of the blade passage frequency BPF.

- Blade vibrations does not play a significant role in the noise radiated by fans and other machines running in air. 
	- Therefore the materials usually does not matter
