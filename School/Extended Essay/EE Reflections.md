I first wanted to know the noise level of the propeller but that was found to be very challenging. I lacked the theoretical knowledge and the equipment to model or actually create the experiment. I think I could have done a lacklustre one but that would have been inaccurate without large margins of uncertainty. Therefore I modified the research into efficiency that way the theory is easier and the experiment will also be simpler to conduct without having to start again from scratch. The hardest thing right now at the moment is theory and how I should measure efficiency. There seems to be different ways efficiency can be measured for propellers. The priority at the moment is to actually create the necessary propellers which has been proving to be difficult because I need to schedule with others to be able to operate the 3d printer.
