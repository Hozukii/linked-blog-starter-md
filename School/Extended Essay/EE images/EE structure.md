### Introduction
- Why topic is of personal interest
- Discuss why the topic is worthy of investigation
- Background information 
	- Identify the revelant principles of phycis
- Any information foreign to physics
	- ex. investigating the motion of a football to most effecvely score a goal - rules of football
### Methodology
- Include diagram of your experimental set up
- Discuss of controlled variables
	- Justify why they have to be controlled and how they can affect the outcomes
- Safety evaluation
	- does not apply to data-based and/or theoretical topics
### Data collection
- Raw quantitative data & qualitative observations
	- only note relevant qualitative observations
	- Numerical values and text inside tables do not count towards word limit
- measurement uncertainties
	- always include in raw data table 
	- Propagate uncertainties for processed data
### Data analysis & conclusion 
- Must derive a numerical value that answers your RQ from processing your data
	- ex. trendlines
- Directly answer RQ at the start of your conclusion
- Always refer to data in your conclusion
- Justify your conclusion with scientific research 
### Evaluation 
- evaluation is more for critiquing the methodology 
- Strengths & weaknesses 
	- ideally 2 each
	- Discuss improvement that could reduce your weaknesses 
- Extensions
	- must add value to the original investigation
	- cannot be a simple change in the dependent variable
	- 
### Tips and trickes
- Proccess your data asyou collect them
- Conclusion is only worth 2 marks - focus on your application of scientific ideas instead of how accurate your outcome is.
