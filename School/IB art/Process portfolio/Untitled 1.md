Looking at the final result, I implemented a more changes/elements. I added a red  outline around the subject, which gives it a paper cut-out feel, while also enhancing the background foreground separation and making the subject pop more distinctly from busy background. I did experiment further with adjustment layers, changing saturation or adding blur effects but I reverted back to the original state. The original saturation struck  a balance between dull and flashy. Adding the blur almost made the image too realistic which strayed away from the illustration like look that was prevalent in James Jean's works. 
Reflecting on this project as a whole, I feel that it significantly improved my understanding and implementation of colour. Going from usually only working with monochromatic colours to a complex palette was a daunting task at first. It was also a great experience for me to improve my limited skills on digital painting learning how to use rending textures, or using layers, adjustment layers. While, I use 3D digital softwares, I rarely use any 2D painting software. Creating this artwork involved me using multiple mediums and creating one coherent artwork. In the future, I would like to explore multi-modal artworks as this is the first time I have done such a thing. However, I think that I could have improved with the texture of the skin and hair. I resorted to using the abstract shapes to make the skin visually interesting and almost to hide the imperfections. In the future I would like to be able to paint skin with better rendering techniques and texture
