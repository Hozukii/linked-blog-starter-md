... Ultimately, I'm incredibly pleased with how this piece resolved. The primary reason for this satisfaction stems from pushing my blending capabilities to a new level. I feel I achieved much smoother gradations and more seamless tonal transitions than in previous works, really building up the values effectively. This complexity, however, meant it became the most time-consuming artwork in my portfolio; the meticulous layering required significant dedication. Looking at the overall chromatic scheme, the chosen palette [mention if it's warm/cool/muted/vibrant, e.g., "leans heavily towards cooler tones" or "employs a relatively high-saturation palette"] creates a distinct [mention the mood/atmosphere, e.g., "somber atmosphere," "sense of vibrant energy," "dreamlike quality"], which I believe successfully conveys the intended feeling of the piece.

Option 2 (Slightly more emphasis on personal achievement):

... Looking at the final result now, the final artwork is different from the initial sketches that I had made in the beginning. However ,I'm genuinely happy with how it turned out. What stands out most for me personally is the breakthrough I had with blending. I feel like I unlocked a new level of control, managing to create really smooth transitions between colours and tones that I hadn't achieved before. That detailed work definitely came at a cost â€“ this piece took significantly longer than any other, demanding a lot of patience. The overall tone of the artwork, shaped by the specific colour harmony I selected [mention specifics like "using mostly analogous blues and greens" or "contrasting warm and cool colours"], establishes a [mention mood, e.g., "calm and introspective mood" or "dynamic and somewhat unsettling feeling"], which I feel resonates well with the initial concept.



 Looking at the final result now, the final artwork is different from the initial sketches that I had made in the beginning. However, I'm really satisfied with how it turned out. This was the first time that I actually made a complete artwork is Blender. Usually, I usually only make models. I had to think about the composition, colour scheme, and other aspects that I usually ignore when using Blender. This work also took significantly longer than the other artworks that I have made in the past. While making all the models by myself was a good experience, I think it would be more practical in the future to use already existing assets in some parts of the artwork. 
Option 3 (More concise):

... Overall, I'm really satisfied with the final outcome, largely because I successfully took my blending technique much further here. Achieving those subtle gradations and smooth tonal shifts was a key goal, and I feel I met it. Unsurprisingly, this commitment to detailed blending made it the most time-intensive piece I've undertaken for the portfolio. The resulting colour scheme [e.g., "dominated by earthy tones" or "utilizing a split-complementary approach"] works effectively, I think, to establish the intended [mention mood/atmosphere, e.g., "grounded yet ethereal atmosphere" or "tense and dramatic mood"].
