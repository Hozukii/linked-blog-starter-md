Reflecting on this implementation, the abstract shapes did successfully **establish the subject as the clear focal point**, especially given the **strong visual contrast** from the red hanafuda-inspired markings. However, integrating these elements highlighted that the **subject's rendering lacks sufficient surface texture**, making it feel somewhat flat. Additionally, the **desaturation** of the abstract forms themselves created an unintended effect; instead of supporting the subject, they feel muted and lack **visual vibrancy**. The choice of the green background also proved problematic, resulting in a **color discord** that fails to **harmonize** with the overall palette.


Reflecting no how the abstract shapes integrated into the artwork, I think that it successfully established a clear focal point on the subject especially as the strong red hanafuda stickers/cards stands out. However, the shapes are desaturated and muted which lacks the vibrancy that I originally had in my artwork. Additionally, the green background does not harmonize with the overall colour palette due to the fact that the green introduces an additional primary colour which breaks the balance from the blue/red colour scheme.
