I attempted to experiment with the colour schemes and contrast however, the balance between the background, the flower and the subject was not harmonious. The stark value contrast between the deep backgrounds and the high-key subject created a jarring separation, while the saturated hues of the floral elements failed to integrate cohesively, disrupting the overall visual unity.

I attempted to experiment with the colour schemes and contrast however, the balance between the background, the flower and the subject was not effectively established. The strong negative space of the dark backgrounds overwhelmed the composition, leading to poor figure-ground integration. The vibrant flowers competed with the subject for visual dominance, preventing a clear focal point or harmonious visual hierarchy.

Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art with Blender, a 3D digital software. My idea was to replace the distinct forms of the flowers with an abstract representation to resolve the issues of visual competition identified earlier. By transforming the recognizable floral shapes into more ambiguous, flowing forms [as seen in the Blender model], the aim was to reduce their visual weight and allow them to function as atmospheric or textural elements rather than distinct subjects. This shift in approach is intended to strengthen the visual hierarchy, ensuring the central character remains the undisputed focal point and allowing the background elements to support, rather than detract from, the main figure.

Expanded Option 1 (Focus on Resolving Conflict):

Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art with Blender, a 3D digital software. My idea was to replace the distinct forms of the flowers with a non-representational, abstract structure, aiming to resolve the visual tension observed previously. This decision stemmed directly from the earlier experiments where the recognizable shapes and potentially saturated colours of the literal flowers created an unavoidable conflict, competing aggressively for visual dominance with the subject. Their distinct identities drew the eye, fragmenting the composition. By developing more ambiguous, sculptural forms using Blender [as shown in the preview], which rely on flow and volume rather than specific detail, the goal is to subordinate these elements. They can now contribute texture and depth without asserting themselves as individual subjects, thereby allowing the central figure to emerge clearly as the primary, intended focal point of the artwork.

Expanded Option 2 (Focus on Integration and Support):

Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art with Blender, a 3D digital software. My idea was to replace the distinct forms of the flowers with an abstract representation, specifically aiming for better visual integration within the overall composition. The challenge was to retain a sense of organic complexity reminiscent of nature, while strategically moving away from literal depiction that caused fragmentation. The resulting abstract shapes [see Blender model], crafted to emphasize fluidity and interconnectedness, are intended to function primarily as supporting elements. They aim to add depth through layering, introduce textural variation that complements the subject's rendering, and contribute to the overall atmosphere without demanding separate attention. The goal is for these forms to harmonize seamlessly with the subject, reinforcing its presence and securing its position as the undisputed focus, rather than acting as isolated points of interest.

Expanded Option 3 (More Direct, Emphasis on Hierarchy):

Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art with Blender, a 3D digital software. My idea was to replace the distinct forms of the flowers with abstract shapes to deliberately restructure and clarify the visual hierarchy. Recognizing that the identifiable, detailed forms of the flowers naturally drew too much attention and challenged the subject's prominence, I utilized Blender to generate forms [example pictured] that are significantly less defined and possess a more unified, flowing character. This abstraction is a strategic move designed to reduce their inherent visual weight and push these elements further back in the perceptual space. By simplifying their structure and removing specific details, they are intended to frame and enhance the main subject, guiding the viewer's eye towards it, thereby resolving the earlier compositional imbalance caused by competing elements.

Expanded Option 4 (Focus on Form and Function):

Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art with Blender, a 3D digital software. My idea was to replace the distinct forms of the flowers with an abstract visual language, exploring its potential within the composition. Transitioning to Blender allowed me to focus on purely formal qualities – investigating shape, complex curves, interplay of light and shadow on volume – detached from the need for literal representation [as seen in the model]. The primary function of these abstract forms shifts from symbolic representation (of flowers) to a primarily compositional role. They are designed to create rhythm and movement within the background, define negative space in a more dynamic way, and provide a sophisticated, textured environment that complements the central figure. This approach ensures the backdrop enhances the subject aesthetically and thematically without disrupting the visual flow towards the main point of interest.


Recently, I had been experimenting with abstract art using Blender, a 3D digital software. My previous attempts showed that the distinct, recognizable forms of the flowers created visual conflict, competing with the subject for visual dominance and preventing a clear focal point. My idea, therefore, was to replace these distinct floral shapes with abstract representations to resolve this compositional imbalance.

Using Blender , I deformed by twisting and stretching simples shapes. By making the forms less defined, I aimed to reduce their visual weight. Within blender, I also experimented with the render engine. 

This shift towards abstraction was a deliberate attempt to restructure the visual hierarchy. The goal was to subordinate these background elements, ensuring they harmonize with and enhance the main figure, rather than clashing with it. Ultimately, I wanted to secure the subject as the undisputed focal point and achieve a more visually cohesive and balanced artwork. Within Blender, 


The act of abstracting involves breaking down recognizable forms. This can symbolize the deconstruction of old, rigid definitions of humanity, reflecting the broadening and widening understanding you mentioned. It's a visual representation of moving beyond simple biological or traditional boundaries.

Furthermore, I realized the abstract shapes could actively reinforce the core theme. The deconstructing of the flowers to abstract shapes is a visual representation of the deconstruction of the rigid, physical definitions of humanity. It shows the human definition is moving beyond the simple biological boundaries

The process of abstraction itself, involving the deconstruction of recognizable forms, serves as a visual metaphor for breaking down rigid, outdated definitions of humanity. It symbolizes the necessary shift towards a broader understanding that moves beyond simple biological or traditional boundaries.
