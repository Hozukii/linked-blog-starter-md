"Through this exhibition, I invite viewers to critically examine the influences shaping their thoughts and identities, particularly regarding technology. I encourage a reassessment of their dependence on these tools, ensuring that they remain the active users rather than becoming subservient to technology. My aim is not to be cynical but to advocate for a more vigilant and reflective approach."

From this exhibition, I want the viewer to question the things that they allow to influence and shape their mind and the self especially with technology. They should question their reliance and use to make sure that they are the one utilizing the tool not the other way around. I'm not trying to be cynical but we should be a bit more wary.


ensuring that they maintain control over technology instead of being controlled by it

"My intent is not to adopt a cynical tone but to promote a more thoughtful and cautious approach."
