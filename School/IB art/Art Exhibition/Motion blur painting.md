- When painting in the motion blur, using both the colour of the clothes and the background and streaking them creates the effect of motion
- painting the background after sketching the person is hard maybe keep the sketching to the minimum or have a reference sketch to use

### Reflections
- 17/09/2024
	- Can't decide if whether to do color or not
		- I feel like color would add another aspect of complexity that I wouldn't want as well as I don't know how well the colors will mix
	- can't decide between digital and physical
		- I have done a detail sketch and it went well and I'm afraid to do it through physical paint.
		- Digital allows for small fixes ad can precisely control how much the colors are going to be mixed
	- Decided to go with digital art
		- Allows for more detail
		- Doesn't punish experimentation because I can easily go back or work in different layers 
		- Can precisely change the mixing of tones/colours
