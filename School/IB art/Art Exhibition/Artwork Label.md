This collage, made from overlapping rectangles cut from magazines, depicts my daughter. My intention is to capture the dichotomy between her child-like qualities and her complicated maturity. I incorporated more detail and realism in her gaze, while the rest breaks out of representation into abstraction, where borders and planes deconstruct into color and pattern. The physicality of Jenny Saville’s “Reverse” is a major influence on this work.

  
This piece was inspired by a young, aspiring artist who attended the summer art classes at MIAD. The moment I saw her work, I immediately felt a connection because I understood the chaos and brokenness that she attempted to convey through her sketches. The theme that began to emerge from my piece was identity. In this piece, I wanted to capture the essence of different aspects of who I am as a person. People can get to know me through what I have witnessed, through my flaws, and lastly, through my words. I have learned to be very careful with what I speak aloud because words can have a very prominent effect on others.

This piece took inspiration from James Jean

I was inspired by mountaineers who risks their live to discover the peaks of the Earth. I tried to paint the vastness and almost the loneliness of the process of discovery through watercolour. 

This artwork took major inspirations from the paper cut-outs of Henri Matisse. The 



The idea was to show how we are all influenced by the environment while in the most isolated situations. I tried various ways to highlight isolation into my artwork. I tried to isolate the subject through the composition by using staffage

The flower is a symbolism for the growth that humans goes through due to outside influences that directly flows into our mind.

I wanted to connect the artwork to human emotions and behaviour. Like my previous artwork, it explores what are the elements that differentiate us / humans from other beings.
