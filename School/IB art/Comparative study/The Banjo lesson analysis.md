# Text Elements
The subject ^zG7tm4fG

In the middle, there is a old man and a young boy. The old man is siting on
a wooden chair. The old man is supporting the banjo so the boy can hold it properly.
The man is bigger than the boy and the boy is sitting in his lap. 
He is teaching the banjo to the boy. Neutral face with their eyes facing 
downward into the banjo. They are fully focused and quiet.   ^Z1efTEsA

light ^d6wLcN0s

Two light sources. One from the left and one from
the right.  ^3g0fTy3i

with its cool tone, the left light source might be a window ^uuZenjUH

On the right, seen through the reflection of light on the tablecloth,
the light seems to be warmer suggesting that it is some kind of fire 
light source like a fireplace, or oven?(since it seems to be a kitchen) ^sI0EdlkQ

The light sources create a vignette creating focus onto the subjects.
Emphasizing their focus so no other things are in its view.    ^tVg4lXv6

The two different light sources also create a divide in tone in the painting. ^AtAeqBWR

From the left, much darker and cool tone surround the left and also the old man  ^WmhALOcw

From the right, the much warmer and lighter source which reflect off of the young boy. 
it suggests the dark past that they had to endure and the bright future that is ahead for 
the future generations.  ^KfYXsMxd

Background ^PWz1CKYZ

Many kitchen tools like a pan and pots.  ^ATCWjpKH

As well as a dining table with a jug and a tablecloth  with a plate.  ^V95YW8MF

On the left side, there are also clothes on hanged on the chair
and the wall. There is a top shelf as well. There are paintings on wall. 
There are also many items on the floor which are hard to recognise.
The floor is made out of rough and uneven wood. 
The items suggest that this room is a common living space and also 
might suggest the lack of space that this household has had with many 
different types of items in the same room. The furniture that they own 
also shows that in the least, they were not rich.  ^eqNRpQVM

The man holding the banjo can be a symbol of how the old 
generation will support the younger generation so they could live a 
better life than they were able to.  ^bP4sFrtG

https://artincontext.org/the-banjo-lesson-painting-henry-ossawa-tanner/ ^vIHeAxEV

The difference in tone of the two sides (make a colour palette) ^Vi8Hg567

Henry Ossawa Tanner ^Dr62sTny

Born in 1859 (before the abolishment of slavery), he is an African-American artist and the first, 
African-American artist to be internationally acclaimed. His mom was a former slave and his dad was a bishop.
He studied in Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and moved to Paris in 1891, studying at the Académie Julian. 
From these two culturally different backgrounds, he has been exposed to both American realism and French academic paintings.   ^sWWcRzUn

Cultural context ^0WAkRv26

Slavery - It was abolished in 1865. His mother has been born into slavery. Although, he was a skilled painter,
he was often times not recognised since he was coloured especially in his path since it was very new for a 
African-American to get education let alone at such prestigious places.  ^4bFBDjwu

Minstrel shows - It was a popular form of comedy shows which made fun of racial black stereotypes.  They would
paint their faces black and they often had musical shows with different instruments such as tambourine, banjos, etc... ^oPuv5QXp

Banjo - It was introduced into America through African slaves in the 17th century. In the 1800s, the Banjo was used in 
white culture in a satirical and derogatory way in the form of minstrel shows and blackface culture. After the minstrel era, 
the African American culture mostly stopped utilising the banjo 
  ^DtIs267U

In this painting, the banjo is depicted with care and thought. It humanises the banjo and the people despite the degradation 
done to them by the minstrel culture.   ^XEFxLxC6

Talk about the cultural significance that the painting had after its inception ^pxR1OhLv

Talk about the cultural context about American realism and the French artistic movements and its influence on his paintings. ^t9PL3pbr
