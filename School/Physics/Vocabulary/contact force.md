Forces that involve physical contact (e.g. friction, pushes, pull)
### Normal Force
Force perpendicular to a surface
### Buoyancy forces 
- The ability of any fluid to provide a vertical upwards force on an object
### Elastic restoring forces
$F_H$, 
- For example with steel spring, the weight provide the downwards force, F. In this case the deformation is called extension of the spring, x, and usually plotted horizonal axis
#### Hooke's law 
$$F_H = -kx$$
k - spring constant
x - the length of extension / compression
### Surface Friction
Occurs when we move an object over another surface, forces parallel to the surfaces will resist movement
>[!seealso] Coefficient of friction
>Just before motion begins: $F_f = F_{max} = \mu_sF_N,$ where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of the static friction 
> $0 \le \mu \le 1$

### Friction of Objects with Air and Liquids
- Drag is fraction in fluids, and use the symbol $F_d$
