- **Green house effect** - The natural effect that a planet's atmosphere has on reducing the amount of radiation emitted into space, resulting in a planet warmer than it would be without an atmosphere. 
- However  human activity has changed the atmosphere in ways that are making the Earth warmer known as the **enhanced greenhouse effect**
# A planet's energy balance: an introduction
- Since the only thermal energy which can travel across Space is radiation, for a planet at constant average temperature:
	- the radiant thermal energy received is equal to the radiant thermal energy emitted in the same interval. 

# Luminosity and apparent brightness of the sun: the solar constant
- **Wien's law** - equation determine the surface temperature of planets. 
	- Discussed on: [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Wien's displacement law]]
- Using Wien's law we can determine that the temperate of the sun is **5780K**
- We can find the luminosity, using Stephan Boltzmann's law  $L_{\odot} = \sigma AT^4$
	- Also discussed on [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Black bodies]]
- $L_{\odot} = \sigma AT^4 = (5.67 \cdot 10^{-8}) \cdot (6.05 \cdot 10^{18}) \cdot 5780^4 = 3.83 \cdot 10^{26} W$
- We can also calculate the apparent brightness, b, of the sun just above the earth's atmosphere: $\text{intensity} = \dfrac{power}{area} \space I = \dfrac PA$
- $b = \dfrac{L_{\odot}}{4 \pi d^2} = 1360Wm^{-2}$
- **Solar constant**, S - intensity of the sun's radiation arriving perpendicularly on an area above the Earth's atmosphere
![[Pasted image 20231107213646.png | 350]]

- The mean value of the radiative intensity directed at the surface of the planet is: $S \cdot (\dfrac{\pi r^2}{4\pi r^2}) = \dfrac{S}{4}$
- For Earth that would be $340Wm^{-1}$
# Non-Black bodies: albedo and emissivity
## Albedo
 - **Albedo** - The total scattered or reflected power/ total incident power. Albedo depends on the nature of the surface and inclination of the radiation to the surface
	 - $albedo = \dfrac{P_{scattereded}}{P_{ncident}}$ No units
- **Incident wave, or ray** - Wave arriving at an object or a boundary
- **Scattering** - Irregular reflections of waves or particles from their original path by interactions with matter
- A perfect black body would have an albedo of 0 : all incident thermal energy would be absorbed. A perfect mirror would have albedo of 1. 
- Albedo of earth is about 0.315
## Emissivity
- **Emissivity** - compares the power of the thermal radiation emitted by a surface to that of a black body at the same temperature. Surface with a greater emissivity emits thermal energy with more power.
- $Emissivity = \dfrac{\text{power radiated per unit area}}{\sigma T^4}$
- $Emissivity = \dfrac{\text{thermal radiatn from an object surface}}{\text{radiaton from an ideal black body surface}}$
- 
	- [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Black bodies]]
- The symbol $e$ or ($\varepsilon$)is sometimes used for emissivity.
- 
# Modelling a planet's energy balance 
- To calculate the earth's temperature, we have the following relevant data:
	- Solar constant = $1.46 \cdot 10^3 Wm^{-2}$
	- Radius of the  Earth = $6.4 \cdot 10^6m$
	- Average emissivity of the Earth = $0.61$
	- Average albedo of the Earth = $0.315$
- As explained before radiant energy received = radiant thermal energy emitted
- Solar constant  x cross-sectional area of planet x (1-albedo) = emissivity x $\sigma$ x surface area of planet x $T^4$
## Effect on the Earth's atmosphere: Greenhouse effect
- So far, we have modelled the Earth's energy balance by treating the planet and the atmosphere as one system. We now need to consider transfers of energy within that system

#### Comparing the radiation emitted by the Sun to the radiation emitted by Earth
![[Pasted image 20231204201824.png | 400]]
- The horizontal scale is not linear and the relative height for the Earth' spectrum has bee *greatly* exaggerated for clarity
- Compared to radiation from the Sun, the thermal radiation from the earth is at a much lower power, with much longer wavelengths
 - A smaller proportion of the infrared from the Earth' s surface is able to pass back out through the same atmosphere. However, over time, the temperature will adjust so that:
- Total thermal power received = total thermal power radiated
#### Energy flow through the Earth's atmosphere
- The mean intensity of thermal radiation arriving at the earth form the sun is $340Wm^{-2}$
	- [[#Luminosity and apparent brightness of the sun the solar constant]]
- albedo of the Earth and its atmosphere is 0.315 meaning that only 68.5% of that 340 is absorbed in the atmosphere or the Earth's surface.

## Greenhouse gases
- The air in the atmosphere approximately (by volume) contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.9% argon
- There are also naturally occuring traces of many other gases, including carbon dioxide and water vapour. 
- Some of these trace gases are called **greenhouse gases**
- **Greenhouse gases**  - Gases in the Earth's atmosphere that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, thereby affecting the temperature of the Earth. The principal greenhouse gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. 
- Molecules of the greenhouse gases  absorb some of the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth's surface. Without these gases, the radiation would continue to travel away from the planet. The molecules will re-radiate the same energy but in random directions. 
### Explanation of absorption of infrared by using Carbon dioxide
- Molecules of greenhous e gases absorb infrared radiation because the atoms within their molecule are not at rest
	- See [[C.1 Simple harmonic motion]]
![[Pasted image 20231204203750.png|150]]
- IF the atoms in a molecule vibrate at the same frequency as the infrared radiation passing through the greenhouse gas, then energy can be absorbed
	- Effect known as the resonance 
	- See:  [[C.4 Standing waves and resonance#Resonance]]
- It raises the molecule to a higher energy level which is quickly released again as the molecule returns to its lower energy level, but the energy is radiated in random directions.
# Enhanced greenhouse effect: global warming
- For the last 300 years, we have been using vast store of chemical potential available from the combustion of coal, oil and natural gas. 
- These energy sources are called **fossil fuels**
- **Fuel** - A store of chemical or nuclear energy that can be used to do useful work
- **Fossil fuels** - Naturally occurring fuels that have been produced by the effects of high pressure and temperature on dead organisms over a period of millions of years. 
- The released of increased amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is responsible for **global warming**
- Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere results in more of the thermal energy that is radiated away from the Earth's surface being absorbed in the atmosphere, some of which is re-radiated randomly back to the surface, increasing its average temperature.
- Fossil fuels are polluting and **non-renewable**
- The burning of fossil fuels is almost certainly the greatest cause of the enhanced greenhouse effect.

![[Pasted image 20231205174802.png|500]]
- These two graphs clearly shows the **correlation** between carbon dioxide levels and increase in temperature. 
## Consequences of the enhanced greenhouse effect 
- Increasing temperature of the oceans, land and atmosphere 
- Climate change, melting snow and ice
- More frequent extreme weather conditions
- Rising sea levels with increased acid levels
## What are the possible solutions to climate change 
There is a wide range of actions that individuals and governments can take
- Support government who will take appropriate and prompt action.
- Accept higher taxation as a method of discouraging energy intense activities and the use of fossil fuels 
- Invest in renewable energy sources for individual homes.
- Use energy-efficient devices and use them less frequently
- Improve home insulation against both hot and cold weather
- reduce the temperatures of homes and hot water used in shows and washing machines(in cold countries)
- Increase the temperature settings on air-conditioners(hotter countries)
- Waste less, Re-use, and buy less
- Reduce methane emissions
- Eat less, especially less
- Make public transport better 
- Support sustainable businesses
- Limit travel
- Reforestation
### World use of energy resources 
- Renewable energy sources should reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.

- Demand for energy has increased
- Covid pandemic had a temporary effect 
- Most of the energy for this increased demand has come from fossil fuels
