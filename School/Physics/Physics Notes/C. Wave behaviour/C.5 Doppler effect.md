# What is the Doppler Effect?
- **Doppler effect** - When there is relative motion between a source of waves and an observer, the emitted frequency and the received frequency are not the same.

- Since $\lambda = \dfrac v f$ and the wave speed, $v$ is constant, the received wavelength will be less than the emitted wavelength. 
## Doppler effect for sound waves
- The most common and easiest examples of the Doppler effect for sound include trains or cars which are moving quickly at a constant speed in an approximate straight line towards , or away from, a stationary observer. 
## Doppler effect for light and other electromagnetic waves
- It occurs with electromagnetic waves  but is more complicated the speed of electromagnetic waves, as measured by an observer, is always the same: it is unaffected by the speed of the source, or the speed of the observer. 
#### $$ \dfrac {\Delta f}f = \dfrac {\Delta \lambda} \lambda \approx \dfrac vc$$
$\Delta f$ - change in frequency
$f$ - reference frequency
$\Delta \lambda$ - change in wavelength  ($\lambda_{\text{reference}} - \lambda_{\text{apparent}}$)
$\lambda$ - reference wavelength
$v$ - velocity of the star
$c$ - speed of light ($3 \cdot 10^8 \ m/s$)

- This equation can be used with a star and the wavelength that travels to earth. 
### Using the Doppler effect to determine speeds
- The change in frequency, $\Delta f$, due to the Doppler effect can be used to determine the speed of an object. 
- Examples:
	- Radar
	- speed guns used by checking the speed of moving vehicles

## Doppler effect with light received from distant stars and galaxies
- Atoms of the elements present in the outer layers of a star absorb light of certain frequencies.
- Each different element produces a unique set of lines and frequencies, and this can be used to identify the element emitting the radiation 
- The line spectra received from stars within distant galaxies are received at lower frequencies from light from similar elements on Earth 
- Measurements of the Doppler effect in line spectra from stars in distant galaxies show that most galaxies are moving apart from each other 
	- The universe is expanding

- **redshift** - Increase in wavelength of electromagnetic radiation due to the fact that the distance between the observer and the source is increasing
- **Blueshift** - Decrease in wavelength of electromagnetic radiation due to the fact that the observer and the source are moving closer. 
- **Recession speed** - The speed with which a galaxy is moving away from Earth
# Equations for use with the Doppler effect for sound (or other mechanical waves) (HL)
![[Pasted image 20240509202730.png|250]]

- $\lambda = \dfrac {\text{total distance}}{\text{the number of waves}} = \dfrac {vt}{ft} = \dfrac vf$
![[Pasted image 20240509202841.png|250]]
- this figure shows the same waves emitted in the same time from a source moving towards a stationary observer with a speed $u_s$ in time, $t$, the source has moved from $S_1$ to $S_2$.
- The number of waves is the same as, but because the sourceh sam moved forwards a distance , $u_s t$, the waves between the source and the observer are now compressed within the length $vt - u_st$ 
- This means relative wavelength,$\lambda ' = \dfrac {v-u_s}f$ 
- In general we can write
#### $$f' = f \begin{pmatrix} \dfrac v {(v \pm u_s )} \end {pmatrix}$$
- This equation is for the Doppler effect from a **moving source** detected by a stationary observer
- $u_s$ is added when the source is moving away from the observer, and subtracted when the motion is towards the observer

#### $$f' = f \begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{(v \pm u_0 )}  v\end {pmatrix}$$
- This equation for the frequency detected by a **moving observer** from a stationary source 
- Remember that these equations cannot be applied to electromagnetic waves
