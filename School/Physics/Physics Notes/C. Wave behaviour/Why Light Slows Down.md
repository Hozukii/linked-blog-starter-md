- Light with high frequency is slowed down more aggressively
- Light with low frequency is slowed down less aggressively
# Why does light slow down?

- Imagine the medium as layers. In this case it is glass
- In a medium, it would be infinitely many layers

- If we look at a thin layer. The layer kicks back the wave by a phase.

- If we add more layers, it would look like a compressed wave.

# Why does layer of glass kick back its phase?

- Since light is a "electromagnetic wave".
- Causes, the materials in the glass to wiggle up and down according to the wave.

- In turn, each thin layer creates a wave.
- It propagates in both directions perpendicular to that layer
- The wave layer of oscillation going to the left is reflected light.

- When added together, net wave created is almost the same as the incident wave but shifted.
- And infinitely many layers will "slow down" the wave
- Since $v = f \lambda$ and light in a vacuum has the same velocity. 
- Lower wavelength light has lower higher frequency. 
- The amplitude of the wave from the oscillations depends on the frequency.
