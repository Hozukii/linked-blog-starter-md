# What is a Wave?
- **travelling wave** - A wave that transfers energy away from a source. (progressive wave)
- **Propagation of waves** - transfer of energy by waves
- **Medium of a wave** -  substance through which a wave is passing-
- **Mechanical waves** - A wave which involves oscillating masses (including sound)
- **electromagnetic waves** - Such as light, involve the oscillations of electric and magnetic fields
- Mechanical travelling waves are oscillating disturbance that travels away from its source through the surrounding medium transferring energy from one place to another. 
- Waves transfer energy without transferring the matter itself
Examples:
- Waves on strings, ropes and springs
- waves of water
- sound 
- earthquake waves
## Models of mechanical waves
- It is convenient to visualize the continuous medium as being composed of separate particles of mass, $m$ separated by springs representing the restoring force that arise when the medium is disturbed.

- **traverse wave** - Wave in which the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction of transfer of energy.

- The top of traverse waves are often called crests
- The bottom of traverse waves are often called troughs
- **Longitudinal wave** - Waves in which the oscillations are parallel to the direction of transfer of energy.

- **Compression** (in a longitudinal wave) - Places where there are increases in the density and pressure of a medium as a wave passes through it
- **Rarefactions** (in a longitudinal wave) - places where there are reductions in the density and pressure of a gas as a wave passes through it. 
## Terms used to describe all types of waves

- **wavelength**,$\lambda$  - The distance between two adjacent crests of a wave. 
	- The shortest distance between two points moving in phase
- A wave travels forward one wavelength,$/lambda$, every time period, $T$
#### $$ \text{wave speed},v = \dfrac \lambda T = f\lambda$$

- **Pulse** (wave) - A travelling wave of short duration

## Sound waves
- **Sound** - Longitudinal waves in air or other media that are audible to humans
- **Ultrasound** - Frequencies of sound above the range that can be heard by humans (approx. $20kHz$)

### Speed of sound
- sound needs a medium to travel through
- Generally, sound will travel faster through mediums which:
	- The particles are closer together
	- there are stronger forces between the particles
- The speed of sound in the air slightly with temperature because the molecules move faster
### Pitch and loudness of sound
- **Pitch** - The sensation produced in the human brain by sound of a certain frequency 
- **Loudness** - subjective measure of our ears' response to the level of sound received
- **Decibel** - Measure of sound level

# Light Waves
- Light can travel across a vacuum. 
![[Pasted image 20240413213147.png|500]]
- Light oscillations are high frequency periodic variations in the strength of electric and magnetic fields. 
- Speed of light in vacuum is $3.00 \cdot 10^8 ms^{-1}$ denoted as $c$
	- However light changes its velocity in different mediums depending on its frequency. [[Why Light Slows Down]]
- In transparent materials light travels at slightly slower speeds 
- **Continuous spectrum** - The components of radiation displayed in order of their wavelengths, frequencies, or energies
- **White light** - Light which contains all the colours of the visible spectrum with approximate equal intensity.. 
- Red has the lowest frequency, Violet has the highest
## Electromagnetic Waves
- Longer wavelengths beyond red is **infrared**
- Shorter wavelength beyond violet are **ultraviolet**
- **Electromagnetic spectrum** - Electromagnetic waves of all possible different frequencies displayed in order. 
- All electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed in vacuum, $c$ 
- They are all composed of oscilatting electric and magnetic fields
