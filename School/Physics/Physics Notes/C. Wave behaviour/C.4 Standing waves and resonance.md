# The Nature of Standing Waves
- **Standing waves** - The kind of wave that can be formed by two similar travelling waves moving in opposite directions. 
	- The  most important examples are fromed when waves are reflect back upon themselves
	- The wave pattern does not move and the waves do not transfer energy
- Standing waves typically occur in confined systems in which waves are reflect back upon each other repeatedly.

- Consider two travelling waves of same shape, frequency, wavelength and amplitude moving in opposite directions. 
- As these waves pass through each other, they will combine to produce and oscillating wave pattern that does not change its position. 

## Nodes and antinodes
- **Nodes** - The position a standing wave where the amplitude is zero
- **Antinodes** - The positions in a standing wave where the amplitude is greatest.

- A system in which there is a standing mechanical wave has both kinetic and potential energy, but energy is not transferred away from the system in the form of a wave along the system. 
- However, there will be energy disspation because of resistive forces. 
- Nodes occur at places where the two waves are always exactly out of phase. 
- Antinodes occur where two waves are exactly in phase. 
- At other places, the displacement will oscillate between zero and a maximum value which depends on the phase difference between the waves moving in opposite directions. 
- Between adjacent nodes all parts of the medium oscillate in phase with each other with the same frequency.
- Each position has constant amplitude.

- Standing waves are possible with any kind of wave: Traverse, longitudinal, 1,2,3 dimensions
## Boundary Conditions
- **Boundary conditions** - The conditions at the ends of a standing wave system. These conditions affect whether there are nodes or antinodes at the ends. 
- Standing waves occur most commonly when waves are reflected back repeatedly by boundaries. 
## Standing wave patterns in strings
- **Harmonic** - Different frequencies of standing waves vibrations of a given system. The frequencies are all multiples of the frequency of the first harmonic. 
- **Modes of vibration** - The different ways in which a standing wave can arise in a given system.

- The first harmonic has lowest possible frequency, $f_0$  and greatest wavelength. 
- If the string is fixed at both ends, the wavelength, $\lambda_0$, of the first harmonic is $2l$ where $l$ is the length of the string. 
- Since $v = f \lambda$ from [[C.2 Wave Model]] 
- $f_0 = \dfrac v {\lambda_0} = \dfrac v{2l}$
- The wavelength of the first harmonic can be found from the length of the system  and the boundary conditions. 
- Standing waves on straings could have boundaries that are "free" meaning there will be antinodes at each end so that the frequnecy of the first harmonic will be the same as for fixed boundaries, which has nodes at each end. 
- If there is a node at one and antinode at other, wavelength of the first harmonic willl be greater and its frequency will be slower.
