;# The Nature of Standing Waves
- **Standing waves** - The kind of wave that can be formed by two similar travelling waves moving in opposite directions. 
	- The  most important examples are fromed when waves are reflect back upon themselves
	- The wave pattern does not move and the waves do not transfer energy
- Standing waves typically occur in confined systems in which waves are reflect back upon each other repeatedly.

- Consider two travelling waves of same shape, frequency, wavelength and amplitude moving in opposite directions. 
- As these waves pass through each other, they will combine to produce and oscillating wave pattern that does not change its position. 

## Nodes and antinodes
- **Nodes** - The position a standing wave where the amplitude is zero
- **Antinodes** - The positions in a standing wave where the amplitude is greatest. 
- ![[Pasted image 20240507190336.png]]
- A system in which there is a standing mechanical wave has both kinetic and potential energy, but energy is not transferred away from the system in the form of a wave along the system. 
- However, there will be energy disspation because of resistive forces. 
- Nodes occur at places where the two waves are always exactly out of phase. 
- Antinodes occur where two waves are exactly in phase. 
- At other places, the displacement will oscillate between zero and a maximum value which depends on the phase difference between the waves moving in opposite directions. 
- Between adjacent nodes all parts of the medium oscillate in phase with each other with the same frequency.
- Each position has constant amplitude.

- Standing waves are possible with any kind of wave: Traverse, longitudinal, 1,2,3 dimensions
## Boundary Conditions
- **Boundary conditions** - The conditions at the ends of a standing wave system. These conditions affect whether there are nodes or antinodes at the ends. 
- Standing waves occur most commonly when waves are reflected back repeatedly by boundaries. 
## Standing wave patterns in strings
- **Harmonic** - Different frequencies of standing waves vibrations of a given system. The frequencies are all multiples of the frequency of the first harmonic. 
- **Modes of vibration** - The different ways in which a standing wave can arise in a given system. 
![[Pasted image 20240507191235.png|650]]

- The first harmonic has lowest possible frequency, $f_0$  and greatest wavelength. 
- If the string is fixed at both ends, the wavelength, $\lambda_0$, of the first harmonic is $2l$ where $l$ is the length of the string. 
- Since $v = f \lambda$ from [[C.2 Wave Model]] 
- $f_0 = \dfrac v {\lambda_0} = \dfrac v{2l}$
- The wavelength of the first harmonic can be found from the length of the system  and the boundary conditions. 
- Standing waves on straings could have boundaries that are "free" meaning there will be antinodes at each end so that the frequnecy of the first harmonic will be the same as for fixed boundaries, which has nodes at each end. 
- If there is a node at one and antinode at other, wavelength of the first harmonic willl be greater and its frequency will be slower. 
## Standing wave patterns of air in pipes
- The air may be set into motion by , for example the simple action of blowing across the open end of the pipe. 
- we need to consider the length and boundary conditions
- The first harmonic is the standig wave with the greatest possible wavelength, $\lambda_0$ , and the lowest possible frequency $f_0$. 
- After determining the wavelength, the eq $v = f\lambda$ can be used to predict harmonic frequencies if the wave speed is known.

- A pipe open at both ends must have antinodes, A, at the ends, and at least one node, N,  in between. 
- A pipe open at only one end has one antinode and one node as its boundary conditions. 
- A pipe closed at both ends must have nodes at the ends and atleast one antinode in between.

- Representation of pipe open at both ends. 
- The wavelength of first harmonic is $2l$ 
![[Pasted image 20240507203312.png|500]]
- Pipe which is closed att one end, open at the other. 
- note that only odd-numbered harmonics are possible with these boundary conditions.

- If a speaker plays a frequency equal to one of the possible harmonics. 
- Some powder can be scattered all along the pipe. When the speaker is played, the powder will split into groups to where vibration is the least.

- Another way of creating standing waves are with adjusting the length of the tube instead of the frequency. 
# Natural frequencies of vibration
- **Natural frequency** - The frequency at which a system oscillates when it is disturbed and then left to oscillate on its own, without influence from outside .
- **Vibrations** - Mechanical oscillation usually of relatively small amplitude
- Vibrating objects will oscillate at a natural frequency which depends on their dimensions and masses. 
## Damping
- like all other mechanical systems, useful energy is transferred from an oscillator into the surrounding in the form of thermal energy and maybe some sound. 
- **Damping** - The dissipation of energy from an oscillator due to resistive forces. 
![[Pasted image 20240508181935.png|500]]

- It is common for the frequency of a vibration to remain approximately constant during damping. 
	- Because although displacements are reduced, the speeds and accelerations also decrease. 

- The degree of damping in oscillating systems can vary drastically
![[Pasted image 20240508182058.png|400]]

- Oscillators can be **heavily damped** because of considerable frictional forces. 
	- Therefore, no oscillations occur because resistive forces are such that the object take a long time to return to its equilibrium.
- Oscillators can be **lightly damped**, so that it continues to oscillate, taking long time to dissipate its energy. 
- If an oscillation is opposed by resistive forces, such that it settles relatively quickly back into its equilibrium position, without ever passing through it, the process is described as **critical damping**
	- like a car suspension
	- Heavily vs critical: heavily returns slowly while critical returns quickly. 
## Forced vibrations
- **(forced) vibration** - Vibrations affected by external periodic forces. 
	- When an external oscillating force acts on a system. 
	- This may tend to make it oscillate at a frequency which is different from its natural frequency.
	- Like pushing a swing
- Most important examples are which the **driving frequency** is the same as the natural frequency. 
- **driving frequency** - The frequency of an oscillating force acting on a system from outside. 
## Resonance
- **Resonance** - The increase in amplitude and energy that occurs when an oscillating system is acted on by an external periodic force that has the same frequency as the natural frequency of the system. 
	- The driving force must be in phase with the natural oscillation. 
- **Resonant frequency** - The frequency at which resonance occurs. 
- The resonant frequency is at, or very close to, the natural frequency. 
- The energy of an oscillation is proportional to its amplitude squared. 
- There may be smaller resonance peaks at values of the driving frequency which are equal to the natural/ resonant frequency divided by 2,3,4 and so on. 
### Examples of resonance
#### Unwanted resonance
- Parts of all machinery may vibrate destructively when their motors are operating at certain frequencies.
- Strong but steady winds, or currents, can also cause resonance in structures. 
![[Pasted image 20240509194110.png|300]]
- To reduce the risk of damage from resonance engineers can:
	- Alter shape of the structure to change the flow of the air or water past it 
	- Change the design so that natural frequencies are not the same as any possible driving frequencies. 
	- Ensure that there is enough damping. 
#### Useful resonance
- The molecules of certain gasses in the atmosphere oscillate at the same frequency as thermal radiation emitted from the Earth.  These gasses absorb energy because of resonance; this results in the planet being warmer than it would be without the gas in the atmosphere. 
- Microwave ovens use electromagnetic radiation in the microwave region. The microwave wavelength equal a vibrational frequency of water molecules, so that the molecules absorb the radiation.
