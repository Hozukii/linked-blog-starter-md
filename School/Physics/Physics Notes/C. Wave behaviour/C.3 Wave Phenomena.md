# Basics behaviours of all waves
- Reflection 
- Refraction
- Diffraction
- Interference 
## Wavefronts and rays 
- **wavefront** - A line connecting adjacent points moving in phase. Wavefronts are wavelength apart and perpendicular to the rays that represent them. 
- **Ray** - a line showing the direction in which a wave is transferring energy
- Rays and wavefront are perpendicular to each other

### Waves in 3D
- Waves spreading from a point with constant speed in three dimensions can be represented by spherical wavefronts. 
- If the source of wave is very far away, the wavefronts will be (almost) straight and parallel and called **plane waves**
- **Plane waves** - Waves travelling in 3 dimensions with parallel wavefronts, which can be represented by parallel rays 
## Transmission, absorption and scattering waves
- **Transmission** - Passage through a medium without absorption or scattering
	- Its the process in which a wave is able to travel though a medium.
- During transmission of waves, there is often absorption of energy
	- some or all of the wave energy is transferred to internal energy within the medium. 
- Waves may also randomly misdirected by interactions with irregularities within the medium. This is called scattering

- **transparent** - A medium through which light can be transmitted, and through which we can see clearly
- **Opaque** - Unable to transmit light (or other forms of energy)
### Wave Power, Intensity, and Amplitude
- As waves spread out, and/or their energy is dissipated, the power that they transfer is reduced. 
####  $$\text {intensity,} \space I = \dfrac PA$$
- $\text{intensity} \propto {\text{amplitude}}^2$
### Waves spreading from a point without absorption
- If waves were *spreading out* from a point source, their intensity will decrease for that reason alone, without any absorption
### In 2 Dimensions (surface waves)
- As surface waves spread away from a point source the wavefronts will extend over greater and greater lengths. 
- In each spreading wavefront the same amount of energy is spread over a greater length, so that the wave amplitude will decrease. 
### In 3 dimensions (such as light and sound)
- The intensity of any waves spreading radially in 3d, without absoprtion, from a point source follows:
  $$ \text{intensity,} I \propto \dfrac 1 {\text {distance}^2}$$
## Reflection of waves and rays
- **Reflection** - Change of direction that occurs when waves meet a boundary between two media such that the waves return into the medium from which they came.
- **incident wave** - wave travelling towards a boundary
- 
- **Law of reflection** - the *angle of incidence* $i$ (angle between ray and normal to the plane) is equal to the *angle of reflection* $r$ (angle between the normal and the reflected ray)

## Refraction of waves
- **Refraction** - Change of direction that can occur when a wave changes speed. (Most commonly when light passes through a boundary between two different media)
- Waves usually changes speed through different mediums which may cause a change in direction

- When waves enter a medium in which they travel more slowly, they are refracted towards the normal. (if not parallel)
- When waves enter a medium in which they travel faster, they are refracted away from the normal. 
### Refractive Index
- **Refractive index**,$n$ - The ratio of the speed of waves in vacuum to the speed of waves in a given medium.
#### $$n = \dfrac cv$$
$$\text {refractive index of a medium} = \dfrac {\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in the medium}}$$

### Snell's law
#### $$\dfrac {n_1}{n_1} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1} = \dfrac {v_2}{v_1}$$
- $\theta_1$ - angle of incident ray from normal
- $\theta_2$ - angle of refracted ray from normal

### Critical angle and total internal reflection
- IF the angle of incident is gradually increased, the refracted ray will get closer and closer to the boundary between two medium. 
- At a certain angle, the refracted ray will be refracted at an angle of exactly $90\degree$ along the boundary. 
- **Critical angle**,$\theta_c$  - Largest angle at which a ray of light can strike a boundary with another medium of lower refractive index without being totally internally reflected. 
- **Total internal reflection** - All waves are reflect back within the medium. CAn only occur when a wave meets a boundary with another medium with a lower refractive index
	- For any angle of incidence, some light will be reflect at the boundary, but for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, *all* the light will be reflected back and remain in the denser medium. 
$$\begin{align} \dfrac {n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1} \\ \\\text{at critical angle,} \theta_1 = \theta_c \space \text{and}  \space \theta_2 = 90\degree \\\\ \dfrac {n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac 1 {sin\theta_c} 
\\\\ \end{align}$$
#### Application of total internal reflection
- Digital communication
	- Light passing into a glass fibre can be "trapped" within the fibre and it will then be able to travel long distances. 
- endoscopes
	- Light from a source outside is sent along fibres to illuminate the inside of the body. 
### Dispersion of light into a spectrum
- The speeds of different colours (frequencies) of light in a particular medium (ex: glass) are not exactly the same. 
- Different colours travelling in the same direction of the same source will not travel along exactly the same paths when they are refracted. 
- **Dispersion (light)** - Separation into different wavelengths / colours (ex: to form a spectrum)
