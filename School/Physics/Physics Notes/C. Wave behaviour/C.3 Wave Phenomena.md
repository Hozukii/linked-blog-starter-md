# Basics behaviours of all waves
- Reflection 
- Refraction
- Diffraction
- Interference 
## Wavefronts and rays 
- **wavefront** - A line connecting adjacent points moving in phase. Wavefronts are wavelength apart and perpendicular to the rays that represent them. 
- **Ray** - a line showing the direction in which a wave is transferring energy
- Rays and wavefront are perpendicular to each other

### Waves in 3D
- Waves spreading from a point with constant speed in three dimensions can be represented by spherical wavefronts. 
- If the source of wave is very far away, the wavefronts will be (almost) straight and parallel and called **plane waves**
- **Plane waves** - Waves travelling in 3 dimensions with parallel wavefronts, which can be represented by parallel rays 
## Transmission, absorption and scattering waves
- **Transmission** - Passage through a medium without absorption or scattering
	- Its the process in which a wave is able to travel though a medium.
- During transmission of waves, there is often absorption of energy
	- some or all of the wave energy is transferred to internal energy within the medium. 
- Waves may also randomly misdirected by interactions with irregularities within the medium. This is called scattering

- **transparent** - A medium through which light can be transmitted, and through which we can see clearly
- **Opaque** - Unable to transmit light (or other forms of energy)
### Wave Power, Intensity, and Amplitude
- As waves spread out, and/or their energy is dissipated, the power that they transfer is reduced. 
####  $$\text {intensity,} \space I = \dfrac PA$$
- $\text{intensity} \propto {\text{amplitude}}^2$
### Waves spreading from a point without absorption
- If waves were *spreading out* from a point source, their intensity will decrease for that reason alone, without any absorption
### In 2 Dimensions (surface waves)
- As surface waves spread away from a point source the wavefronts will extend over greater and greater lengths. 
- In each spreading wavefront the same amount of energy is spread over a greater length, so that the wave amplitude will decrease. 
### In 3 dimensions (such as light and sound)
- The intensity of any waves spreading radially in 3d, without absoprtion, from a point source follows:
  $$ \text{intensity,} I \propto \dfrac 1 {\text {distance}^2}$$
## Reflection of waves and rays
- **Reflection** - Change of direction that occurs when waves meet a boundary between two media such that the waves return into the medium from which they came.
- **incident wave** - wave travelling towards a boundary
- 
- **Law of reflection** - the *angle of incidence* $i$ (angle between ray and normal to the plane) is equal to the *angle of reflection* $r$ (angle between the normal and the reflected ray)
