# Basics behaviours of all waves
- Reflection 
- Refraction
- Diffraction
- Interference 
## Wavefronts and rays 
- **wavefront** - A line connecting adjacent points moving in phase. Wavefronts are wavelength apart and perpendicular to the rays that represent them. 
- **Ray** - a line showing the direction in which a wave is transferring energy
- Rays and wavefront are perpendicular to each other

### Waves in 3D
- Waves spreading from a point with constant speed in three dimensions can be represented by spherical wavefronts. 
- If the source of wave is very far away, the wavefronts will be (almost) straight and parallel and called **plane waves**
- **Plane waves** - Waves travelling in 3 dimensions with parallel wavefronts, which can be represented by parallel rays 
## Transmission, absorption and scattering waves
- **Transmission** - Passage through a medium without absorption or scattering
	- Its the process in which a wave is able to travel though a medium.
- During transmission of waves, there is often absorption of energy
	- some or all of the wave energy is transferred to internal energy within the medium. 
- Waves may also randomly misdirected by interactions with irregularities within the medium. This is called scattering
![[Pasted image 20240429203440.png|400]]

- **transparent** - A medium through which light can be transmitted, and through which we can see clearly
- **Opaque** - Unable to transmit light (or other forms of energy)
### Wave Power, Intensity, and Amplitude
- As waves spread out, and/or their energy is dissipated, the power that they transfer is reduced. 
####  $$\text {intensity,} \space I = \dfrac PA$$
- $\text{intensity} \propto {\text{amplitude}}^2$
### Waves spreading from a point without absorption
- If waves were *spreading out* from a point source, their intensity will decrease for that reason alone, without any absorption
### In 2 Dimensions (surface waves)
- As surface waves spread away from a point source the wavefronts will extend over greater and greater lengths. 
- In each spreading wavefront the same amount of energy is spread over a greater length, so that the wave amplitude will decrease. 
### In 3 dimensions (such as light and sound)
- The intensity of any waves spreading radially in 3d, without absoprtion, from a point source follows:
  $$ \text{intensity,} I \propto \dfrac 1 {\text {distance}^2}$$
## Reflection of waves and rays
- **Reflection** - Change of direction that occurs when waves meet a boundary between two media such that the waves return into the medium from which they came.
- **incident wave** - wave travelling towards a boundary
- 
- **Law of reflection** - the *angle of incidence* $i$ (angle between ray and normal to the plane) is equal to the *angle of reflection* $r$ (angle between the normal and the reflected ray)

## Refraction of waves
- **Refraction** - Change of direction that can occur when a wave changes speed. (Most commonly when light passes through a boundary between two different media)
- Waves usually changes speed through different mediums which may cause a change in direction
![[Pasted image 20240501094918.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240501094950.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240501095007.png|300]]

- When waves enter a medium in which they travel more slowly, they are refracted towards the normal. (if not parallel)
- When waves enter a medium in which they travel faster, they are refracted away from the normal. 
### Refractive Index
- **Refractive index**,$n$ - The ratio of the speed of waves in vacuum to the speed of waves in a given medium.
#### $$n = \dfrac cv$$
$$\text {refractive index of a medium} = \dfrac {\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in the medium}}$$

### Snell's law
#### $$\dfrac {n_1}{n_1} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1} = \dfrac {v_2}{v_1}$$
- $\theta_1$ - angle of incident ray from normal
- $\theta_2$ - angle of refracted ray from normal
![[Pasted image 20240501095838.png|300]]
### Critical angle and total internal reflection
- IF the angle of incident is gradually increased, the refracted ray will get closer and closer to the boundary between two medium. 
- At a certain angle, the refracted ray will be refracted at an angle of exactly $90\degree$ along the boundary. 
- **Critical angle**,$\theta_c$  - Largest angle at which a ray of light can strike a boundary with another medium of lower refractive index without being totally internally reflected. 
- **Total internal reflection** - All waves are reflect back within the medium. CAn only occur when a wave meets a boundary with another medium with a lower refractive index
	- For any angle of incidence, some light will be reflect at the boundary, but for angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, *all* the light will be reflected back and remain in the denser medium. 
$$\begin{align} \dfrac {n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1} \\ \\\text{at critical angle,} \theta_1 = \theta_c \space \text{and}  \space \theta_2 = 90\degree \\\\ \dfrac {n_1}{n_2} = \dfrac 1 {sin\theta_c} 
\\\\ \end{align}$$
#### Application of total internal reflection
- Digital communication
	- Light passing into a glass fibre can be "trapped" within the fibre and it will then be able to travel long distances. 
- endoscopes
	- Light from a source outside is sent along fibres to illuminate the inside of the body. 
### Dispersion of light into a spectrum
- The speeds of different colours (frequencies) of light in a particular medium (ex: glass) are not exactly the same. 
- Different colours travelling in the same direction of the same source will not travel along exactly the same paths when they are refracted. 
- **Dispersion (light)** - Separation into different wavelengths / colours (ex: to form a spectrum)
# Diffraction of waves
- **Diffraction** - The spreading of waves as they pass obstacles, or through apertures. 
- **Aperture** - A hole or gap designed to restrict the width of a beam of light (or other radiation)
![[Pasted image 20240502191829.png|600]]

- For apertures greater than the wavelength, the effects are less noticeable
- Diffraction effects are most significant when aperture = wavelength
- Diffraction at an aperture also occurs when waves are emitted from a source or aerial, or received by an observer. For example:
- **Aerial** - A structure that receives or emits electromagnetic signals.
	- Also called antenna.
- ![[Pasted image 20240502192156.png|200]]
## Examples of diffraction
### Sound
- A typical sound wave may have a wavelength of about 1m.
### Light
- Light has a very short wavelength therefore diffraction of light around everyday objects will not normally be noticed. 
- However, light is still diffracted.
- The fact that light diffracts is evidence of its wave-like structure. 
![[Pasted image 20240502192341.png]]
- It shows the diffraction of monochromatic laser light through an aperture of width less than 0.1mm. 
- **laser** - Source of intense, coherent, monochromatic light.
- **Monochromatic** - Containing only one colour/ frequency / wavelength. 
### Microwaves
- Typical wavelength of the microwaves used in a mobile phone network is 0.1 m. 
### X-rays
- X-ray wavelength are comparable to the sizes of atoms and ions, and their separations, in solids. 
- This means that X-rays are diffracted well by the regular arrangement of atoms. 
# Superposition of waves
- **Principle of Superposition** - The resultant of two or more waves arriving at the same point can be determined by the vector addition of their individuals displacements. 
- When waves have similar frequencies and amplitudes, the effect can be significant. 
![[Pasted image 20240502193250.png|300]]
- Shows an example of combining wave displacements to find a resultant.
# Interference of Waves
- **Interreference pattern (fringes)** - pattern observed when coherent waves interfere. 
- **Coherent waves** - Waves that have the same frequency and a constant phase difference. 

![[Pasted image 20240502193733.png|300]]

- Most commonly occurs between two sources of waves which have the same single frequency and the same wave shape. 
# Constructive and Destructive Interference
- **Path difference** - The difference in the distances from a particular point to two sources of waves. 
![[Pasted image 20240502193955.png|500]]

- At $P_0$, or any other point where $X$ and $Y$ are in phase will create constructive interference. 
![[Pasted image 20240502194122.png|250]]
- **Constructive interference** - When two waves travel in the same direction and are in phase with each other, their amplitude gets added, and the resultant wave is obtained
- So for example:
$$\therefore XP_2 - YP_2 = n \lambda \ \ n \in \mathbb{Z}$$

- The condition for constructive interference:
#### $$\text {path difference} = n\lambda$$
- **Destructive interference** - occurs when waves come together so that they completely cancel each other out. When two waves destructively interfere, they must have the same amplitude in opposite directions
![[Pasted image 20240502194924.png|250]]
- The condition for destructive interference:
#### $$ \text {path difference} = \left( n + \dfrac 12 \right) \lambda$$
- These conditions assume the usually situation: the waves are emitted in phase with each other. If the waves were exactly out of phase, these conditions would be reversed. 
- Constructive and destructive interference describe the extreme possibilities of wave super position. 
- Since $\text {intensity} \propto \text{amplitude}^2$, the intensity has quadrupled. This is possible because the intensity at places of destructive interference has been reduced. 
![[Pasted image 20240502195232.png|375]]

- This shows the overall interference pattern produced. 
- Interreference is a property *only* of waves. 

## Young's double-slit interference experiment
- Famous experiment which provided the first evidence that light travelled as waves.

![[Pasted image 20240506202604.png|400]]


- The separation of fringes in young's experiment
#### $$s = \dfrac {\lambda D}d$$
![[Pasted image 20240504095432.png|400]]

![[Pasted image 20240506203042.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20240506203118.png]]
### $$n\lambda = d sin\space \theta = \Delta x$$

## Interference of other types of waves 
- Interference patterns are not common because it is difficult to produce two *coherent* sources for some type of wave in a uncontrolled, random process. 
### Microwaves
- Microwaves have a wavelength of a few centimetres
- They have the same effects as young's experiment. 
- The eq. $s \approx \dfrac {\lambda D}d$  can't be used because the eq. works from the assumption that light have small wavelengths. 
![[Pasted image 20240504100118.png|300]]
### Sound
- **Signal generators** - Electric equipment used to supply small alternating currents of a wide range of different frequency. 
![[Pasted image 20240504100224.png|400]]

# Closer Look at Single-Slit Diffraction of Light (HL)
## Interference within a single wavefront 
- Imagine each plane of wavefront as series of points of "secondary wavelets"
- **Secondary waves** - The propagation of waves in two or three dimensions can be explained by considering that each point on a wave is a source of secondary waves . 
- ![[Pasted image 20240506211524.png|200]]
- if $\theta$ is zero, all the secondary waves will interfere constructively because there is no path difference. 
![[Pasted image 20240506211639.png|300]]

 - The path difference is 
 - $bsin\theta$ and this increases as $\theta$ increases. 
 - There will be angles at which the waves  from the two edges of the slit interfere constructively.
 - if the secondary wavelets from the edges of the slit interrfere constructiev
