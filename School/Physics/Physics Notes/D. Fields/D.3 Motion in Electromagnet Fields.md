# The motion of charged particles in uniform electric fields
## Stationary charged particles
- A particle with charge $q$ situated in an electric field will experience a force $F = Fq$ towards the oppositely charged plate. 
- "Stationary" mobile charges will accelerate along a field line in a uniform electric field.

# The motion of charged particles in uniform magnetic fields
- A "stationary" charge in a magnetic field will not experience any magnetic force
- Any charge *moving* in a magnetic field will experience a magnetic force unless its motion is parallel to the magnetic field.

- In this image:
	- If the charge was positive, the  force on the particle acts perpendicularly downwards, into the paper. 
	- If the particle was negatively charged, the the force on the particle acts perpendicularly upwards, out of the paper.
- Because of the magnetic force, the charged particle will not continue to move in a straight line. 
- Because the force is perpendicular to the velocity, this is the necessary condition for circular motion.

>- Dots represent the magnetic field out of the plane (North to South)
>- Crosses represent the magnetic field into the plane (South to North)

- During its circular motion in a perpendicular magnetic field, the speed and the kinetic energy of the charged particle will remain constant.
## Equation for the force on a charged particle moving across a magnetic field
#### Lorentz law
- Describes the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. 
$$F = qvBsin\theta$$
F - force in $N$
$q$ - charge in coulombs
$v$ is velocity in $ms^{-1}$
B - magnetic field strength in Teslas(T)
$\theta$ angle between the velocity vector of the charged particle and the magnetic field.
- if a particle charge ($q$) moves with a velocity ($v$) in the presence of an electric field ($E$) and a magnetic field ($B$), then it will experience a force 
- This is simply because a moving charge creates a magnetic field
- Therefore, magnetic field inside another magnetic field will feel a force
---
- If a particle smoving perpendicularly its $sin(90) = 1$ so it can be reduced to $F = qvB$
- This magnetic force can be considered as the *centripetal force* causing circular motion
- We know that from:
	- [[A.2 Forces and Momentum#Circular Motion and Centripetal forces]]
	- $F = \dfrac {mv^2}r$
- So that $qvB = \dfrac{mv^2}r$, which can be rearranged to shaow that:
- $r = \dfrac{mv}{qB}$
- For any given situation, if only one of these fields is non-zero, the formula simplifies. If ($E$) is non-zero and ($B$) is zero, the formula becomes ($E = qE$) and we have the simple eelectrostatic force. If ($E$) is zero and ($B$) is non-zero, the formula becomes ($F = qvBsin\theta$) , which is the formula for the magnetic force. This is why the Lorentz force is given by ... 
$$F = qE + qvBsin\theta$$

# Motion of charged particles in both an electric field and a magnetic field
- Any charged particle which is moving across both an electric and a magnetic field will experience two forces, one force parallel to the electric field and one froce perpendicular to the magnetic field.
![[Pasted image 20240207182020.png|250]]
- Example for a negative charged particle
- if the electric force, $F_E$ = magnetic force, $F_B$: $Eq = Bqv$ so that:
	- If the motion of a charged particle in unaffected by perpendicular electri and magnetic fields, then , its velocity: 
	- $v = \dfrac EB$ 
## Charge to mass ration particle, q/m
- If neither the mass nor the charge of a particle is known, then the **charge / mass ratio**, q/m becomes all-important. 
- All particles with the same velocity, $v$ and q/m ratio will follow the paths of the same radius, $r$ when they pass into some magnetic field, $B$ shown by:
	- $r = \dfrac {mv}{Bq}$
- We cannot determine the mass of an unknown particle without its charge, or we cannot determine the charge of an unknown particle without its mass
- Rearranging the previous equation, we get:
	- $\dfrac qm = \dfrac v {Br}$
- To determine the speed of a particle, perpendicular electric and magnetic fields can be adjusted until the particles' motions are unaffected. then:
	- $v = \dfrac EB$ 
# Forces on current-carrying conductors 
- Shows a wire carrying a current $I$ through a wire which is at an angle $\theta$ to a uniform magnetic field, $B$. 
- The electrons have a average speed of $v$ through the wire, so that in time $t$ they travel an average distance $L = vt$
- We can rewrite the equation($F = qvBsin\theta$):
	- $F = (\dfrac qt)(vt)B sin\theta$ 
	- to show that:
### $$F = BILsin\theta$$
#### BIL Law (alternate Lorentz law)
F - magnetic force acting on the conductor, measured in N
B - magnetic flux density of the field, measured in Tesla
I - Current flowing through the conductor, measured in meters
$\theta$ - angle between the conductor and the magnetic field lines, measured in degrees. 
- fundamental equation in electromagnetism 
- Is the force equation on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field with magnetic flux density
- The maximum force occurs when the conductor is perpendicular to the field

- Sows a wire carrying an electric current across a magnetic field. The current is perpendicular to the magnetic field. 
- The two fields are in the same plane, so it is easy to consider the combined field that they produce. 
- Obve the wire , the fields act in opposite directions and they combine to produce a weaker field . 
- Below the wire, the fields combine to give a stronger field. 
## Simple dc motor
- **Motor effect** - magnetic force on a current in a magnetic field, as used in electric motors
![[Pasted image 20240207184551.png|300]]

- Increasing the current, strength of the magnetic field, or the number of turns in a coil will all make the motor spin faster. Winding the coil on an iron coil will also increase the rate of rotation.
## Parallel current-carrying wires 
![[Pasted image 20240207184641.png| 300]]
- If both are carrying a current , then each wire is in the magnetic field created by the current in the other. Both wires will experience a force, and suing the left-hand rule, the force will attract between the wires if the currents are in the same direction. 
- The force are equal and opposite 
![[Pasted image 20240207184811.png|600]]
- The force on current $I_1$ Can be determined from determined from $F = BILsin\theta$ but in this case, the field is perpendicular to the wire so:
	- Force on unit length of conductor carrying current, $I_1 = \dfrac FL = B_2 I_1$ 
- We saw in:
	- [[D.2 Electric and magnetic fields#Magnetic field strength around a current in a long straight wire]]
	- $B = \dfrac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$
So that the force per unit between parallel currents: 
- $\dfrac FL = \mu_0 \dfrac {I_1I_2}{2\pi r}$
-
