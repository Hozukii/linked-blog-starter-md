# Reference frames
- **reference frame** A coordinate system from which events in space and time are measured
	- **coordinate system** - numerical way to identify location and time
- Precise events are used to simplify our understanding
- **Events** - Single incident that occurs exactly at a precise time and location
## Different reference frames
- **Observer** - In relativity, its a hypothetical person who takes measurements from only one specific reference frame. 
	- An observer is always stationary relative to their own reference frame
- For example: If you happened to bang your head on a luggage at a train 2 times, what were the coordinates of these two events and the distance between them?
	- There are 3 possible reference frames that could be occupied by three different observers:
	1. An observer taking measurement sitting on the platform as the train moves past
	2. An observer taking measurements sitting on a seat in the train
	3. An observer taking measurements walking up the train at the same velocity as you. 
- According to newton each of the observers will record different values for how fast you are moving and you position when you bang your head
- but they will all agree on the time between the two events occurring and the distance you have moved up the carriage between the two events. 
### Inertial reference frames
- All reference frames are equally valid: there is no "correct" reference frame.
- **Inertial reference frame** - A frame of reference that is neither accelerating nor experiencing a gravitational field, in which masses obey Newton's lows of motion. 
# Newton's postulates concerning time and space
## Galilean relativity
- **Galilean relativity** - How relative motions were described before the discovery of special relativity 
- In Galilean relativity, al Newton's laws of motion are the same in all frames of reference (inertial)
- Whenever we move our point of view from one reference frame to another, we need to do what is called a *transformation* by applying standard equations
- **Galilean transformation** - The non-relativistic method of mathematically relating observations between reference frames
- If in reference frame $S$ the coordinates of an event are $(x,t)$, in reference frame $S'$, which has relative velocity $v$ compared to $S$, the coordinates of $(x',t')$ are 
#### $$x' = x - vt \ \ \text{and} \ \  t' = t$$
### Velocity Addition Equation
- **velocity addition** - Equation which connects the velocities of the same object as observed in two different reference frames
- If in reference frame $S$, the velocity of an object is $u$, in a reference frame $S'$,which has relative velocity of $v$ compared to $S$, the same movement will be recorded as having a velocity, $u' = u-v$
