# Reference frames
- **reference frame** A coordinate system from which events in space and time are measured
	- **coordinate system** - numerical way to identify location and time
- Precise events are used to simplify our understanding
- **Events** - Single incident that occurs exactly at a precise time and location
## Different reference frames
- **Observer** - In relativity, its a hypothetical person who takes measurements from only one specific reference frame. 
	- An observer is always stationary relative to their own reference frame
- For example: If you happened to bang your head on a luggage at a train 2 times, what were the coordinates of these two events and the distance between them?
	- There are 3 possible reference frames that could be occupied by three different observers:
	1. An observer taking measurement sitting on the platform as the train moves past
	2. An observer taking measurements sitting on a seat in the train
	3. An observer taking measurements walking up the train at the same velocity as you. 
- According to newton each of the observers will record different values for how fast you are moving and you position when you bang your head
- but they will all agree on the time between the two events occurring and the distance you have moved up the carriage between the two events.
