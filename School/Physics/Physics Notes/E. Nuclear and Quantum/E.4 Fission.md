# Nuclear Fission
- **Fission fragments** - The nuclei produced in a fission reaction
	- typically gamma rays and neutrons
- Nuclear fission can sometimes be a spontaneous (random, without cause)from of radioactive decay of very massive nuclei 
- Fission can be deliberately induced in nuclei which would not otherwise readily split into fragments. 
	- Most commonly, nuclear fission is induced by using slow-moving neutrons

- **Fissile** - Capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction
	- Uranium-235 is the world's only naturally occurring nuclide that is capable
- For example:
  $$ \ce{^1_0 n} + \ce{^{235}_92U} \to \ce{^{144}_{46}Ba} + \ce{^{89}_{36}Kr} + 3\ce{^1_0n} + \text{about 180 MeV of energy (+ gamma ray photons and antineutrinos)}$$

- The majority of the energy released is the form of kinetic energy of the fragments. Neutrons and gamma rays also transfer significant energy. 
## Changes of binding energy and mass during 
- For nuclear fission to occur, the fission fragments must  be more stable than the original nucleus. 
	- The fission fragments must have higher values of binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus undergoing fission
