# Nuclear Fission
- **Fission fragments** - The nuclei produced in a fission reaction
	- typically gamma rays and neutrons
- Nuclear fission can sometimes be a spontaneous (random, without cause)from of radioactive decay of very massive nuclei 
- Fission can be deliberately induced in nuclei which would not otherwise readily split into fragments. 
	- Most commonly, nuclear fission is induced by using slow-moving neutrons

- **Fissile** - Capable of sustaining a nuclear fission chain reaction
	- Uranium-235 is the world's only naturally occurring nuclide that is capable
- For example:
  $$ \ce{^1_0 n} + \ce{^{235}_92U} \to \ce{^{144}_{46}Ba} + \ce{^{89}_{36}Kr} + 3\ce{^1_0n} + \text{about 180 MeV of energy (+ gamma ray photons and antineutrinos)}$$

- The majority of the energy released is the form of kinetic energy of the fragments. Neutrons and gamma rays also transfer significant energy. 
## Changes of binding energy and mass during 
- For nuclear fission to occur, the fission fragments must  be more stable than the original nucleus. 
	- The fission fragments must have higher values of binding energy per nucleon than the original nucleus undergoing fission

- In fission, the release of energy from the nuclei must result in a decrease in mass
# Controlled release of nuclear energy in chain reactions
- **Chain reaction (nuclear)** - Self-sustaining nuclear fission because fission causes further fission. 
	- After each U-235 fission, 2 or 3 neutrons are created.
- Sustained fission is impossible unless we arrange for suitable circumstances
- Chain reactions will not normally occur. because:
	- U-235 atoms will only be a relatively small percentage of all the uranium atoms in the material being used
	- Neutrons are penetrating particles and many will simply pass out of the material without interacting with any nuclei
	- In order to cause fission, the neutrons need to be travelling relatively slowly 
	- Because neutrons are uncharged, some will be absorbed into u-235 and u-238 nuclei without causing fission. 
## Fuel enrichment
- Metal uranium is said to be lot more common than gold
- The isotopes in uranium ore that is extracted from the ground are approximately in the ratio 99.3%uranium-238 and 0.7% Uranium-235.
- **Fuel enrichment** - Increasing the percentage of U-235 in uranium fuel in order to make it of use in a nuclear power station or for a nuclear weapon.
- U-238 absorbs neutrons too much which will also discourage a chain reaction.
- Enrichment cannot be done chemically because isotopes of the same element have identical chemical properties, so physical process needs to be involved. 
- The remaining uranium is called *depleted uranium*
### Critical mass
- **Critical mass** - The minimum mass needed for a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction
