2# Nuclear fission
- we looked at fusion briefly in [[E.3 Radioactive Decay]]
- Nuclear fusion involves changing to a more stable system, with an increase in binding energy and the release of energy, mostly in the form of kinetic energy
![[Pasted image 20241004100341.png|300]]
- An example of fusion is between hydrogen-2(deuterium) nucleus and hydrogen-3 (tritium) nucleus. 
$$ \ce{^2_1H} + \ce{^3_1 H} \to \ce{^4_2 He} + \ce{^1_0n} + \text{energy}$$
- For nuclear fusion to occur the nuclei must initially have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the repulsive forces between the positive charges. This requires extremely high temperatures, more than $10^7$ K
- If nuclear fusion could be sustained, it would release enormous amount of energy. 
# Formation of Stars
- **Interstellar matter** - matter that exists in the space between stars (usually at very low density)
	- On average 70% is hydrogen, 28% is helium, and 2% is other elements
- **Nebula** - Identifiable, diffuse "cloud" of interstellar matter mainly gasses
- In places of increased density, gravitational forces can increase kinetic energy of particles, which is equivalent to increasing temperature
	- Eventually energy will be great enough for nuclear fusion 
		- Atleast $10^7 K$ for helium
- **Main sequence stars** - Stable stars which are fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores
	- 2 type of ways fusion can happen in main sequence stars
- Only small amounts of interactions in protons results in fusion 
	- Closer the protons the greater the frequency of interaction
	- Thus high density is needed to sustain fusion
## Proton-proton cycle
- **Proton-proton cycle** - The simplest nuclear fusion which converts hydrogen into helium releasing large amounts of energy in medium and smaller-sized main sequence stars 

$$ 4 \ce{^1_1H} \to \ce{^4_2He} + 2 \ce{^0_1e} + \text{neutrinos} + \text{photons}$$
- It's a 3 step process (don't need to remember)
	- Energy released in the 3 step process is $27MeV$
1. Two protons fuse to make $\ce{^2_1H}$ nucleus. One proton converts into a neutron in a beta-plus decay, also forming a positron and neutrino
$$\ce {^1 H} + \ce{^1 H} \to \ce{^2_1 H} + \ce{^0_1 e^+} + v$$
2. The deuterium nucleus fuses with another proton to make helium-3 releasing gamma rays
$$ \ce{^2_1 H} + \ce{^1_1 H} \to \ce{^3_2 He} + \gamma$$
3. 2 helium-3 nuclei combine to make helium-4 releasing two protons
$$ \ce{^3_2 He} + \ce{^3_2 He} \to \ce{4_2} + 2 \ce{^1_1 H}$$---
## CNO cycle 
- **CNO cycle** - nuclear fusion process in larger main sequence stars
	- Converts hydrogen to helium
- For stars which have a mass significantly larger to sun because of their higher temperature in the core
- CNO means Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen which are the catalysts 
- It's a 6 step process (don't need to remember)
	- Turns 4 protons to one helium nucleus and release about the same amount of energy ($27MeV$)

## Stellar equilibrium 
- Stellar equilibrium - Main sequence stars are in equilibrium under the balanced effect of radiation pressure acting outwards and gravitational forces acting inwards

## Lifetimes of main sequence stars
- **Lifetime (of main sequence stars)** - The duration for which a star is fusing hydrogen into helium, emitting radiation and maintaining stellar equilibrium 
- main stars will come to the end of their lifetimes when most of the hydrogen in the core has been converted to helium
- The rate of fusion in more massive (hotter) stars is so much greater, that they have significantly shorter lifetimes
# Comparing main sequence stars
 - As a rough guide, our Sun may be considered to be an "average" main sequence stars
 - The differences between main sequence stars are not random. There is very clear pattern, because the rate of fusion depends on the the mass
 - Main sequence stars of greater mass have greater radii, greater rates of fusion, higher temperatures, greater luminosities and shorter lifetimes

- Luminosity scale is relative to the Sun
- he dotted lines represent constant radius $R_\odot$ = Radius of sun  ($7.0 \cdot 10^* m$)

# Evolution of stars 
- **Stellar evolution** - Describes the changes that occur in a star's lifetime
	- here it is used to describe what happens after the depletion of hydrogen
- Core begins to contract since gravitational potential energy is transferred to kinetic energy
	- which also increases the temperature significantly 
- This causes fusion of hydrogen outside of the core
- The rate of fusion in the shell is greater than in the core
- The resulting increased radiation pressure produces a significant expansion of the star.
- Overall effect is a reduction in surface temperature and change to redder color called a red giant
- **Red giants (and super giants)** - formed by the increased rate of nuclear fusion that occurs because of the greater temperatures created in the collapse of main sequence stars at the end of their lifetimes
	- Only the smallest main sequence stars will become red giants or super giants
![[Pasted image 20241004113744.png|550]]
- **planetary nebula** - Material emitted from the outer layers of a red giant star at the end of its lifetime. The core the becomes a white dwarf star
- **White dwarf star** - Relatively hot stars, blue/ white, but their luminosity is low because of their small size
	- **Electron degeneracy** - The process that stops dwarfs from collapsing 
- Red super giants do not evolve into white dwarf stars because their electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient. 
- **Supernova** - Sudden and very luminous explosion of a massive star, resulting in a neutron star or black hole
	- Happens for stars with mass between 8 and 20 solar masses

# Distances form Earth to stars
- In topic [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers]] We leaned $b = \dfrac L{4\pi d^2}$ this can be used to find distance from the Earth
- Problem is we have no direct way of knowing their luminosities.
- Astronomers have identified a few "standard candles" which have known luminosities wherever they are located. 
## Distances to "nearby" stars
- If very precise measurements are made of "nearby" stars, their positions are observed to move very slightly (forwards and backwards) during the course of a year. This is called stellar parallax
- **Stellar parallax** - Method of determining the distance to a nearby star from measurements of its parallax angle
- It only measures accurately for stars less than about 300 ly from Earth
- Using a telescope, astronomers measure the parallax angle, $p$,between, for example of stars made in December and June
![[Pasted image 20241005003704.png|]]

- The parallax angle is so tiny so that they are measured in **arc-seconds**
	- **arc-seconds** - Angle which is 1/3600 of one degree
#### $$\text{parallax angle, } p \text{ (rad)} = \dfrac {1.50 \cdot 10^{11}}{d(m)}$$

- Assuming $p$ is $\sin p$ which is $\tan p$ for very small angles
#### $$\text{distance, } d \text{(parsec)} = \dfrac 1 {p \text{(arc-second)}}$$
### Summary of the non-SI units used in astronomy
![[Pasted image 20241005004624.png]]

## The age of an expanding Universe 
- In [[C.5 Doppler effect]] The speed of stars and galaxy away from Earth can be determined from the doppler shifts of radiation received from the on Earth. 
![[Pasted image 20241005004742.png|400]]
- Assuming that all the stars began moving at the time of the Big bang, an estimate for the Universe can be determined from the gradient of this graph, by $v = \dfrac {\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$
using the graph:
$$1 \cdot 10 ^4 kms^{-1} = \dfrac {140Mpc}{time}$$
- Converting to SI units
$$10^7 = \dfrac {140 \cdot (3.09  \cdot 10^{22})}{t}$$
$$ \therefore t = 4.3 \cdot 10^{17}s = 1.4 \cdot 10^{10}\text y$$
# The creation of different elements
- **Nucleosynthesis** - Creation of new nuclides from existing, less massive, nuclei 
- Higher temperatures are needed for nucleosynthesis, and these exist in the cores of red giants and super gaints
- Red giants (formed from main sequence star mass less than $4M_\odot$)
	- core can reach $10^8K$ large enough for nucleosynthesis of carbon and oxygen
- larger red giants (formed from main sequence star mass between $4 M_\odot$ - $8M_\odot$)
	- core can exceed $10^9K$ large enough for nucleosynthesis of neon and magnesium
- Red super giant stars (formed from main sequence stars mass greater than $8M_\odot$)
	- Enough temperature for nucleosynthesis of elements as heavy as silicon and iron
