## Isotopes 
- **radioactivity** - Spontaneous transmutation of an unstable nucleus, accompanied by the emission of ionizing radiation in the form of:
	- alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays
- **transmutation** - When nuclide form a different element after emitting a particle
- A material involved in process of radioactivity is described as radioactive
- a atom with a unstable nucleus may be referred to as a radioisotope or radionuclide
- For example :$\ce{^{235}_{92} U}$
	- At some (uncertain) time in the future any $\ce{^{235}_{92} U}$ nucleus may emit an alpha particle and when this happens, we say that the nucleus has *decayed* or *transform
- **Daughter product** - the resulting nuclide after a radionuclide emits a particle
## Radioactivity experiments
![[Pasted image 20240920095401.png|400]]
- radioactive nuclide is contained in the "source". 
- The radiation enters the GM tube through the end "window" it causes ionization of gas inside and a sudden tine burst of current. 
- rate-meter measure the rate at which radiation is detected. 
	- measured in radioactive count (count per min or sec)
- **Background radiation** - Radiation from radioactive materials in rocks, soil and building materials, as well as cosmic radiation escaping from artificial sources
	- **Background count** - typically about 0.25 to 0.5$s^{-1}$
	- it should be deducted from all readings before they are processed
# Alpha particles, Beta particles, and Gamma rays 
# Alpha particles 
- The composition is the same as a helium-4 nucleus: 2 protons and 2 neutrons, very stable.
- Can be represented as symbol $\ce{^4_2 \alpha}$ or $\ce{^4_2 He}$
- The emission of an alpha particle leads to loss of 2 protons and 2 neutrons shown in a generalized radioactive decay equation:
#### $$\ce{^A_Z X} \to \ce{^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y} + \ce{^4_2\alpha}$$
$$ \text{parent nucleus} \to \text{daghter nucleus} + \text{alpha particle}$$
- The change in more stable nucleus is equivalent to a decrease in unclear potential energy.  The energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of eh alpha particle. 
- Alpha sources can be used to generate small amounts of electrical energy, or in places that are difficult to access, such that replacing a power source would be problematic. 
	- Satellites, space probes
### Penetrating power and ionizing ability
- **Penetrating power** - The penetrating power of nuclear radiation depends upon the ionizing power of the radiation. 
	- The radiation continues to penetrate mater until it has lost (nearly) all of its energy. The greater the ionization per cm, the less penetrating power it will possess. 
![[Pasted image 20240920104633.png|600]]
- It has high kinetic energy but limited penetration of matter. 
	- they transfer significant amounts of energy in collisions with other atoms/ molecules. 
- The The collisions transfer the energy needed to ionize a large number of atoms/ molecules in the material through which the alpha particles are passing. 
- Typically, all the alpha particles emitted will be absorbed by a few centimeters of air, or a sheet of paper. 
- Alpha particles would be absorbed in the outer layers of skin 
## Beta-negative particles
- In an unstable nucleus it is possible for a uncharged neutron to be converted into a positive proton and negative electron. 
	- This also involves the creation of another particle called an **antineutrino**, $\overline v$
- An antineutrino is an example of a **antiparticle (antimatter)**
- **Antineutrino** - Low-mass, uncharged and very weakly interacting particle emitted during beta-negative decay. 
	- travelling near the speed of light, so they are very penetrating an very difficult to detect
#### $$\ce{^1_0n} \to \ce{^1_1p} + \ce{^0_{-1}e} + \overline v$$
![[Pasted image 20240920112802.png|400]]

- The beta particles in this decay have a range of energies up to 0.55MeV
#### Penetrating power and ionizing ability 
- Beta particles are considerably less massive than alpha particles thus
	- they transfer less energy in ionizing collisions with atoms and molecules. 
	- Therefore, the travel further before they lose their kinetic energy and become absorbed
- typically travel about 30 cm in air, although more energetic particles ma go as far as one meter.
- They will mostly pass a sheet of paper easily and their absorption in other materials is usually characterized by saying a sheet of aluminum of thickness 3 mm will absorb them all 
- Should be considered as a possible health hazard if they are outside the body
### Beta-positive particles
- Similar to beta-negative decay 
- **Beta-positive decay** - radioactive decay resulting in the emission of a positron (and a neutrino)
- Represented by the symbol $\ce{^0_1 \beta^+}$ or $\ce{^0_1e}$
- A neutrino $v$ is created at the same time
#### $$ \ce{^1_1 p }\to \ce{^1_0n} + \ce{^0_1 \beta^+} +v $$
## Gamma rays 
- **Gamma rays** - high-frequency, high-energy electromagnetic radiation (photons) released from unstable nuclei. 
- Typical wavelength is about $10^{-12}m$. 
- Corresponds to an energy of about 1Mev (use $E = hc/\lambda$)
- emitted after an unstable nucleus has emitted an alpha or beta particle.
- Represented by $\ce{^0_0 \gamma}$
- For example:
	- when thorium-234 nucleus is fromed from a uranium-238 by alpha decay
	- the thorium nucleus contains excess energy and said to be in an excited state. 
	- It returns to a more stable state by emitting a gamma ray:
#### $$\ce{^{234}_{90}Th^*} \to \ce{^{234}_{90}Th} + \ce{^0_0 \gamma}$$
- since it has no mass or charge, the composition of the emitting nucleus does not change
	- no transmutation
### Penetrating power and ionizing ability
- causes less ionization, so that they have greater penetrating power
- Usually assumed that it is not significantly absorbed in air.
- if a beam is spreading out, its intensity falls with distance.
- At least 2 cm of solid lead to needed to absorb most gamma rays. 
- Easiest to detect because they are very penetrative
- They are so penetrating so sources outside the body can be as dangerous as sources inside the body . 
## Summary of the properties of alpha, beta, and gamma nuclear radiations

## Deflection of nuclear radiations in electric and magnetic fields
- From their sources, alpha and beta radiation will be emitted in all directions but they can be formed into narrow beams by slits
- Since alpha and beta particles is a flow of charge, they will be deflect if they pass across a an electric or magnetic field 
- Gamma radiation is uncharged ,so it cannot be deflected this way.
![[Pasted image 20240920121503.png|300]]
- shows 3 types of ionizing radiation perpendicularly across a strong magentic field
- the path of a charged particle moving perpendicularly across a magnetic field can be calculated from: [[D.3 Motion in Electromagnet Fields]]
$$ r = \dfrac {mv}{qB}$$
- radius of an alpha particle's path may be about 400 times the radius of a beta particle: it is deflected much less
---
- alpha and beta particles can also be deflected by electric fields. 
![[Pasted image 20240920121524.png|300]]
- Alpha particles are attracted to the negative plate
- Beta particles are attracted to the positive plate
- A combination of linear speed in one direction and constant perpendicular force produces a parabolic trajectory 
- The deflection of alpha particles is small in comparison to beta particles
