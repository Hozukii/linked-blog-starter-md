## Isotopes 
- **radioactivity** - Spontaneous transmutation of an unstable nucleus, accompanied by the emission of ionizing radiation in the form of:
	- alpha particles, beta particles or gamma rays
- **transmutation** - When nuclide form a different element after emitting a particle
- A material involved in process of radioactivity is described as radioactive
- a atom with a unstable nucleus may be referred to as a radioisotope or radionuclide
- For example :$\ce{^{235}_{92} U}$
	- At some (uncertain) time in the future any $\ce{^{235}_{92} U}$ nucleus may emit an alpha particle and when this happens, we say that the nucleus has *decayed* or *transform
- **Daughter product** - the resulting nuclide after a radionuclide emits a particle
## Radioactivity experiments
![[Pasted image 20240920095401.png|400]]
- radioactive nuclide is contained in the "source". 
- The radiation enters the GM tube through the end "window" it causes ionization of gas inside and a sudden tine burst of current. 
- rate-meter measure the rate at which radiation is detected. 
	- measured in radioactive count (count per min or sec)
- **Background radiation** - Radiation from radioactive materials in rocks, soil and building materials, as well as cosmic radiation escaping from artificial sources
	- **Background count** - typically about 0.25 to 0.5$s^{-1}$
	- it should be deducted from all readings before they are processed
# Alpha particles, Beta particles, and Gamma rays 
# Alpha particles 
- The composition is the same as a helium-4 nucleus: 2 protons and 2 neutrons, very stable.
- Can be represented as symbol $\ce{^4_2 \alpha}$ or $\ce{^4_2 He}$
- The emission of an alpha particle leads to loss of 2 protons and 2 neutrons shown in a generalized radioactive decay equation:
#### $$\ce{^A_Z X} \to \ce{^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y} + \ce{^4_2\alpha}$$
$$ \text{parent nucleus} \to \text{daghter nucleus} + \text{alpha particle}$$
- The change in more stable nucleus is equivalent to a decrease in unclear potential energy.  The energy is transferred to the kinetic energy of eh alpha particle. 
- Alpha sources can be used to generate small amounts of electrical energy, or in places that are difficult to access, such that replacing a power source would be problematic. 
	- Satellites, space probes
### Penetrating power and ionizing ability
- **Penetrating power** - The penetrating power of nuclear radiation depends upon the ionizing power of the radiation. 
	- The radiation continues to penetrate mater until it has lost (nearly) all of its energy. The greater the ionization per cm, the less penetrating power it will possess. 
![[Pasted image 20240920104633.png|600]]
- It has high kinetic energy but limited penetration of matter. 
	- they transfer significant amounts of energy in collisions with other atoms/ molecules. 
- The The collisions transfer the energy needed to ionize a large number of atoms/ molecules in the material through which the alpha particles are passing. 
- Typically, all the alpha particles emitted will be absorbed by a few centimeters of air, or a sheet of paper. 
- Alpha particles would be absorbed in the outer layers of skin 
## Beta-negative particles
- In an unstable nucleus it is possible for a uncharged neutron to be converted into a positive proton and negative electron. 
	- This also involves the creation of another particle called an **antineutrino**, $\overline v$
- An antineutrino is an example of a **antiparticle (antimatter)**
- **Antineutrino** - Low-mass, uncharged and very weakly interacting particle emitted during beta-negative decay. 
	- travelling near the speed of light, so they are very penetrating an very difficult to detect
#### $$\ce{^1_0n} \to \ce{^1_1p} + \ce{^0_{-1}e} + \overline v$$
![[Pasted image 20240920112802.png|400]]

- The beta particles in this decay have a range of energies up to 0.55MeV
#### Penetrating power and ionizing ability 
- Beta particles are considerably less massive than alpha particles thus
	- they transfer less energy in ionizing collisions with atoms and molecules. 
	- Therefore, the travel further before they lose their kinetic energy and become absorbed
- typically travel about 30 cm in air, although more energetic particles ma go as far as one meter.
- They will mostly pass a sheet of paper easily and their absorption in other materials is usually characterized by saying a sheet of aluminum of thickness 3 mm will absorb them all 
- Should be considered as a possible health hazard if they are outside the body
### Beta-positive particles
- Similar to beta-negative decay 
- **Beta-positive decay** - radioactive decay resulting in the emission of a positron (and a neutrino)
- Represented by the symbol $\ce{^0_1 \beta^+}$ or $\ce{^0_1e}$
- A neutrino $v$ is created at the same time
#### $$ \ce{^1_1 p }\to \ce{^1_0n} + \ce{^0_1 \beta^+} +v $$
## Gamma rays 
- **Gamma rays** - high-frequency, high-energy electromagnetic radiation (photons) released from unstable nuclei. 
- Typical wavelength is about $10^{-12}m$. 
- Corresponds to an energy of about 1Mev (use $E = hc/\lambda$)
- emitted after an unstable nucleus has emitted an alpha or beta particle.
- Represented by $\ce{^0_0 \gamma}$
- For example:
	- when thorium-234 nucleus is fromed from a uranium-238 by alpha decay
	- the thorium nucleus contains excess energy and said to be in an excited state. 
	- It returns to a more stable state by emitting a gamma ray:
#### $$\ce{^{234}_{90}Th^*} \to \ce{^{234}_{90}Th} + \ce{^0_0 \gamma}$$
- since it has no mass or charge, the composition of the emitting nucleus does not change
	- no transmutation
### Penetrating power and ionizing ability
- causes less ionization, so that they have greater penetrating power
- Usually assumed that it is not significantly absorbed in air.
- if a beam is spreading out, its intensity falls with distance.
- At least 2 cm of solid lead to needed to absorb most gamma rays. 
- Easiest to detect because they are very penetrative
- They are so penetrating so sources outside the body can be as dangerous as sources inside the body . 
## Summary of the properties of alpha, beta, and gamma nuclear radiations
![[Pasted image 20240920120658.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240920120715.png]]
## Deflection of nuclear radiations in electric and magnetic fields
- From their sources, alpha and beta radiation will be emitted in all directions but they can be formed into narrow beams by slits
- Since alpha and beta particles is a flow of charge, they will be deflect if they pass across a an electric or magnetic field 
- Gamma radiation is uncharged ,so it cannot be deflected this way.
![[Pasted image 20240920121503.png|300]]
- shows 3 types of ionizing radiation perpendicularly across a strong magentic field
- the path of a charged particle moving perpendicularly across a magnetic field can be calculated from: [[D.3 Motion in Electromagnet Fields]]
$$ r = \dfrac {mv}{qB}$$
- radius of an alpha particle's path may be about 400 times the radius of a beta particle: it is deflected much less
---
- alpha and beta particles can also be deflected by electric fields. 
![[Pasted image 20240920121524.png|300]]
- Alpha particles are attracted to the negative plate
- Beta particles are attracted to the positive plate
- A combination of linear speed in one direction and constant perpendicular force produces a parabolic trajectory 
- The deflection of alpha particles is small in comparison to beta particles
## Chart of the nuclides and decay series
- **Chart of nuclides** - A chart which displays every possible nuclide on axes of proton number and neutron number
- Changes from transmutation can be tracked on a chart of the nuclides
- ![[Pasted image 20240921180234.png|350]]
- **Decay series** - A series of nuclides linked in a chain by radioactive decay
	- Each nuclide in the chain decays to the next until a stable nuclide is reached
- The relative proportions of different
![[Pasted image 20240925105449.png|400]]

![[Pasted image 20240925105723.png|400]]
# Pattern of radioactive decay 
- Individual nuclei do not decay in any pattern (decays are random) and each decay occurs without any obvious cause, (decays are spontaneous)
- Paradoxically, such randomness and unpredictability on the scale of individual nuclei, results in predictability when we consider very large number of nuclei
## Activity of a radioactive source
- **Activity**,$A$ - The number of nuclei which decay in a given time
$$A = \dfrac {\Delta N}{\Delta t}$$
- **Bequierrel, Bq** - The SU unit for activity
	- 1Bq = one nuclear decay every second
- The activity of a source is proportional to the number of undecayed atoms it contains undecayed
![[Pasted image 20240926081735.png|400]]
- The count rate from a source measured is not the same as its activity 
	- because equipment can't detect everything
- **Half-life**, $T_{1/2}$ - The time taken for the activity, or count rate,  from a pure source to be reduced to half
	- also equal to time taken from the number of radioactive atoms in a pure source to be reduced to half
![[Pasted image 20240925115142.png]]
### Experimental determination of half-life
- In principle, the half-life of any radionuclide can be determined from a graph of count rate against time
- However it might be difficult
	- half-lives will usually be too short or too long for convenient measurement
	- When a nuclide decays it is probable that its daughter product will also be radioactive. 
		- meaning there will be often two radioisotopes with different half-lives
## Practical uses of radionuclides

Wide range of uses including:
- diagnosis of illness
- treatment of cancer
- food preservation and sterilization of medical equipment
- determining the age of rocks
- Locating faults in metal structure
- carbon dating
- determining thickness
- smoke detection
- The choice of a suitable radionuclide for each of these applications requires careful consideration of the health risks involved.
- **carbon dating** - Using the radioactive decay of carbon-14 to estimate the age of once-living material
### Medical tracers
- **tracer (radioactive)** - Radioisotope introduced into a system to track where it goes by detecting the radiation it emits
	- most common radioactive substance - technetium-99m
# The energy inside a nucleus
- **Binding energy** - The energy released when a nucleus is formed from its constituent nucleons
	- alternative it is equal to the work required to completely separate the nucleons
	![[Pasted image 20240926082529.png|400]]
- **Binding energy per nucleon** - measure of the stability of nucleus
#### $$\text{binding energy per nucleon} = \dfrac{\text{tottal binding energy}}{\text{number of nucleons in the nucleus}}$$
![[Pasted image 20240926083731.png|400]]
- How average binding energy per nucleon varies with nucleon number. 
## Nuclear fission and fusion
- **Nuclear fission** - Nuclear reaction which a massive nucleus splits into more stable smaller nuclei
	- total binding energy is greater than the binding energy of the initial nucleus. 

- **Nuclear fusion** - combination of two small nuclei to produce a more massive singe nucleus
	- binding energy is greater than the combined binding energies of the nitial nuclei, with the release of energy
### Mass-energy equivalence 
- Einstein's implication is that particles (at rest) have intrinsic energy $$E = mc^2$$
- mass and energy are both but different manifestations of the same thing

### Units of measurement for masses of atomic particles
- Rest mass - mass of an isolated particle that is at rest relative to the observer
- **Atomic mass unit (amu)**, $u$ - exactily 1/12 of an mass of an isolated carbon-12 atom:
	- $1u = 1.661 \cdot 10^{-27}kg$
	- $1u$ corresponds to $9.315 \cdot 10^8 eV$
### Nuclear reaction involve changes of mass
- If a nucleon system becomes more stable, energy is released, total mass decreases and the total binding energy increases (because the nucleons have become harder to separate)
### Mass defect
- **mass defect** - The difference in mass between a nucleus and the total mass of its nucleons if they were separated
	- Equal to nuclear binding energy
# The strong nuclear force and nuclear stability
- In a stable nucleus, we can consider that very short-range attractive strong forces are balanced by the longer range repulsive electric forces
- The stability of a nuclide depends on the ratio of neutrons to protons in its nucleus
 ![[Pasted image 20240926091841.png|200]]
 ![[Pasted image 20240926091856.png|500]]
- Shows the chart of nuclides. 
- blue are stable nuclides. The others have been created artificially.
- Green are well-known radionuclides 
 ![[Pasted image 20240926092026.png|350]]
 - For nuclides with $Z< 20$, stable nuclides have $N/Z \approx 1$
 - For larger nuclides $N/Z$ gradually increases to a maximum of about 1.5
	 - As elements get heavier, they require a higher number of neutrons to offset the increasing electrostatic repulsion between the more abundant protons. 
### Variations in binding energy per nucleon
- Adding more nucleons to a nucleus clearly increases its total binding energy
	- but average binding per energy also varies
![[Pasted image 20240927100925.png|500]]
- Iron-56 is the most stable
- adding neutrons larger than nuclei with A > 56 increases the total binding energy, but has little effect on the binding energy per nucleon
- Adding more nucleons increases the binding energy per nucleon because it has more things to bind with but at a certain point this effect is offset by the electromagnetic force
# What can we learn from the spectra of alpha, beta and gamma radiations?
## Alpha particle spectrum
- Many radionuclides wchi emit alpha particles, only emit one precise energy
- some can emit alpha particles with different energy
- **Alpha particle spectrum** - The range of discrete energies possessed by alpha particles emitted from the same radionuclide
- alpha parnicle emitted for Americium-241 will have one of the following energies
	- 5.389MeV (1%)
	- 5.443 (12.5%)
	- 5.486 MeV(86.0%)
	- 5.512 MeV (0.2%)
	- 5.545 MeV(0.3%)
- Energies are discrete
- It's possible because can be left in its ground state, or in one of several discrete excited states
![[Pasted image 20240927104206.png]]
## Gamma ray spectrum
- **Gamma ray spectrum** - Range of discrete photon energies that may be emitted from a single radionuclide
![[Pasted image 20240927104622.png|200]]
-  The discrete energy levels of nuclei are the reason why alpha particles and gamma rays are emitted with discrete energies
## Beta particles spectrum 
- **Beta particle spectra** - The continuous range of different energies emitted from the same radionuclide
![[Pasted image 20240927105451.png]]
- The emission of a beta particle involves another particle. This particles may travel in random directions, so that a continuous range of beta particle energies is possible
# Radioactive decay in more mathematical detail
- We can determine values of activity, or count rate, any time, not just for times which for times which are whole number multiples of the half-life
	- for example we can know the activity of a source, which has half-life of 5.3 years in a year's time
- If a rate of change is always proportional to the, it is described as an exponential change $$ \dfrac {\Delta N}{\Delta t} \propto N$$
#### $$\dfrac {\Delta N}{\Delta t} = - \lambda N$$
- $\Delta N$ - change in quantity of nucleus
- $\Delta t$ - change in time
- $N$ - quantity of nucleus 
- $\lambda$ - decay constant - probabilty of a nucleus decaying per unit time:
$$ \lambda = -\dfrac{\Delta N/N}{\Delta t}$$
 Si unit: $s^{-1}$
 
- We saw from [[#Activity of a radioactive source]] that:
	- $A = \dfrac{\Delta N}{\Delta t}$ therefore:
#### $$ \text{activity}, A = \lambda N$$
## Solutions to the decay equation

#### $$\text{number of undecayed nuclei}, N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$$
- $N_0$ - represents the number of undecayed nuclei in a source at the beginnig
- $t$ - time 
- $N$ - undecayed nuclei at the end of time $t$
#### $$\text{activity},A = \lambda N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$$
#### $$\text{count rate}, C = C_0 e^{-\lambda i}$$
![[Pasted image 20240927132437.png|300]]
-  We could use the ratio $\dfrac X {4\pi r^2}$ to determine the fraction of radiation emitted that arrives at the detector, 
- but that would assume:
	- no radiation was absorbed between the source and the detector
	- The radiation was emitted equally in all direction
## Decay constant and half-life
- substituting $t = T_{1/2}$ to $N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}$
$$ \dfrac {N_0}2 = N_0 e^{-\lambda T_{1/2}}$$
$$ \therefore \ln 2 = \lambda T_{1/2}$$
- we get:
#### $$ T_{1/2} = \dfrac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$$
### experimental determination of half-life
##### Radioisotopes with relatively short half-lives
- The decay constant can be determined directly from $C = C_0 e^{-\lambda t}$
![[Pasted image 20240930125810.png|300]]
##### radioisotopes with relatively long half-lives
- We can use $A = \lambda N$
- $N$ can be determined using $\dfrac {mN_A}{\text{relative atomic mass}}$
