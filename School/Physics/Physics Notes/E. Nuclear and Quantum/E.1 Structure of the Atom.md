- **Subatomic particle** - Any particle contained within an atom
- The old model was the [[plum pudding model]]
## Geiger-Marsden-Rutherford experiment 
- They directed a beam of positive charged alpha particles from radium at very thin gold foil. 
- A zinc sulfide detector was moved in a circle around the foil to determine the direction in which alpha particles travelled after striking the foil . 
- Gold foil can be made very thin and the foil may may then only have about 6000 layers of atoms. 
![[Pasted image 20240915093721.png|300]]
- The Geiger and Marsden's results reported that:
	- Most alpha particles passed through the foil
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1800) were deviated through an angle of more than about $10 \degree$
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1000) were deflected through an angle larger than $90\degree$

- The mass of an atom is concentrated in a small volume at the centre
	- Since most passes through
- The nucleus must be positively charged in order to repel the positively charged alpha particles 
- From the experiments he calculated that diameter of:
	- gold nucleus was in order of $10^{-14}m$
	- the whole atom was in order of $10^{-10}m$
## Composition of the nucleus
- The electrons orbit the nucleus because of the centripetal force provided by the electrical attraction between opposite charged. 

| Name of particle | approximate relative mass | relative charge |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| proton           | 1                         | +1              |
| neutron          | 1                         | 0               |
| eletron          | $\frac 1 {1840}$          | -1              |

### What holds the nucleus together? 
- There is a large repulsive force between protons:
$$F = k \dfrac {q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
$F = \dfrac {(8.99\cdot 10^9)\cdot(1.60 \cdot 10^{-16})}{(6 \cdot 10^{-15})^2} \approx 10N$
- To oppose this repulsive force, we know there is a very short-range strong nuclear force. (detail knowledge not required in IB) 
- **Strong nuclear force** - Fundamental force that is responsible for attracting nucleons together. It is a short-range attractive force (range about $10^{-15}m$) but for smaller distances, it is repulsive, and hence it also prevents a nucleus from collapsing
- **Nucleon** - A particle in a nucleus (proton or neutron)
- **Proton number**, $Z$, - number of proton in a nucleus of an atom 
	- Atoms of particular element are identified by their proton number (also called atomic number)
- **Nucleon number**, $A$ - defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus
	- represents the mass of the atom since electrons are (almost) negligible
- **Neutron number**,$N$ - number of neutrons in a nucleus
	- similar to the number of protons, although the ratio of $\dfrac {neutron}{proton}$ generally increases with increasing proton number. 
## Nuclear notation
- **Nuclide** - term used to identify one particular species (type) of atom, as defined by the structure its nucleus. 
	- A *radionuclide* is unstable and will emit radiation
- All with the same proton and nucleon number are described as the same nuclide.
![[Pasted image 20240915093930.png|400]]
### Isotopes
- **Isotope** - One of two or more atoms different nuclides of the same elements 
- For example:
	- Most common isotope of hydrogen is hydrogen-1 $\ce {^1_1 H}$
	- Hydrogen-2 $\ce{^2_1H}$ is called deuterium
	- Hydrogen-3 $\ce{^3_1H}$ is called tritium
	- Hydrogen isotopes are involved in nucleur fusion reactions
![[Pasted image 20240915094540.png|500]]
- Samples of elements often have mixtures of isotopes. They can't be chemically separated. 
- Separation can only achieved by processes that depend on mass. For example, diffusion rate of gaseous compounds. 
- **Diffusion** - Random movement of particles from a place of high concentration to place s of lower concentration. 
- The notation for nuclides can also be applied to the nucleons:
	- e.g $^1_1p$, $^1_0n$, $\ce{^0_{-1}e}$
# Energy levels within atoms
- The total energy of an atom, may be considered the sum of kinetic energy of electrons and the electric potential energy. 
	- Energies within the nucleus are for another discussion and not included in this topic . 
- The energies of electrons within atoms are given negative values because we would have to supply energy to remove them froth e atom (to infinity), where they would have 0 potential energy. 
- Satellites can orbit at any height with a continuous range of possible energy but electrons only have one of a range of very precise values referred to as atomic energy levels
	- They are discrete, and quantized.
- **Atomic energy levels** - One of series of possible discrete (separate) energy levels of an electron within an atom
possible energy levels of hydrogen:
- ![[Pasted image 20240915130457.png|400]]
- The energy levels are drawn to scale vertically but does not matter
- **ground state** - The lowest energy state of an atom / electron
- All energies are negative
- **Ionization energy** - Amount of energy needed to remove an electron from an atom or molecule. (highest energy level shown)
- Given in both joules and electron volts. eV are widely used for atomic-scale energies
## Evidence for energy levels within atoms
### Emission and absorption spectra
![[Pasted image 20240915130538.png|500]]
- **Excitation** - The addition of energy to a particle changing it from its ground state to an excited state.
- When elements are excited, they form a line spectra 
- Each line corresponds to a precise frequency 
- atoms in the gas will absorb the same frequencies as they would emit when given energy.
- **Emission spectrum** - Line spectrum associated with the emission of electromagnetic radiation by atoms, resulting from electrons transitions from higher to lower energy states.
- **Absorption spectrum** - A series of dark lines across a continuous spectrum produced when while light passes through a gas at low pressure
- Since different elements have different energy levels, spectra can be used to identify elements 
## Photons 
- The emission, transmission and absorption of light are not continuous process. They are a very large number of separate events 
- **Transition (between energy levels)** - A photon is emitted when an atom makes a transition to a lower energy level. It emits the equivalent energy to the difference in energy levels. 
![[Pasted image 20240915130604.png|400]]
- The *bundles* of emitted electromagnetic energy are called **photons**.  
- **Photon** - A quantum of electromagnetic radiation.
	- The energy, $E$, carried by one photon of electromagnetic radiation depends only on its frequency, $f$:
#### $$ E = hf$$
- **Planck's constant**, $h$, Fundamental constant of quantum physics which connect the energy and frequency of a photon
	- $6.63 \cdot 10^{-34}Js$
- Since from [[C.2 Wave Model]]
	- $c = f \lambda$:
$$ E = \dfrac {hc}\lambda$$
Visible emission line spectrum of hydrogen:
![[Pasted image 20240915130626.png]]
- Taking one line as example: $434.2nm$ 
$$E = \dfrac {hc}\lambda = \dfrac {(6.63\cdot 10^{-34})\cdot(3.00\cdot10^8)}{434.2\cdot10^{-9}} = 4.58\cdot 10^{-9}J$$
- equal to 2.86eV
- referring back to the energy levels for hydrogen, that is equivalent to the difference between: -0.54eV and -3.39eV
- Therefore, spectral lines were used to determine atomic energy levels
# A mathematical understanding of the Geiger-Marsden-Rutherford experiment
![[Pasted image 20240916110458.png]]
- As an alpha particle approaches a positive nucleus, it loses $E_K$ (kinetic) because it's repelled but that energy is transferred to $E_p$ (potential). 
- Initial $E_K$ = maximum $E_p$ momentarily stored in the system when the alpha particle is at its closest to the nucleus with a separation of $r$ 
#### $$ E_p = k\dfrac {q_{\alpha} q_n}r$$
## Nuclear radii
- **Rutherford scattering** experiments showed that:
#### $$ \text {radius of nucleus} \ R = R_0 A^{\frac 13}$$
- $R$ radius of nucleus
- $A$ - nucleon number
- $R_0$ - Fermi radius  = $1.20 \cdot 10^{-15}$
## Nuclear density
- We can use $\rho = \dfrac mV$ to estimate nuclear density.
- The mass of a nucleus is approximated by:
$$ m = Au$$
- $m$ - mass of nucleus
- $A$ - nucleon number
- $u$ - atomic mass unit - average mass of a nucleon  = $1.661 \cdot 10^{-27}kg$
Therefore:
$$\rho = \dfrac {Au}{\dfrac 43 \pi \left (R_0 A^{\frac 13}\right)^3} =  \dfrac {3u}{4\pi R_0^3}$$
- this shows us that the density does not depend on $r$ (radius)
- The densities of all nuclei are approximately the same .
- $\rho = 2.3 \cdot 10^{17}kg m^{-3}$
## Strong Nuclear force 
- We have assumed it's only repulsive electric force between positive charges. 
- But there is also **strong nuclear force** when individual nucleons are close together. 
	- attractive force
	- but if the the nucleons get really close then it becomes a repulsive force 
- A very energetic alpha particle can get close enough to the nucleons that it is affected by the attractive strong nuclear force as well as the repulsive electric force 
![[Pasted image 20240916110516.png|300]]
# The Bohr model of the hydrogen atom 
- It can be expanded for other elements but we will stick to hydrogen 
![[Pasted image 20240916110942.png|550]]
- All energy levels of hydrogen arranged into 3 groups
- Beginning with the lowest, the ground state $n = 1$
- **Principle quantum number**, $n$ - Number used to describe the energy level of an atom 
- All the transition down to $n=1$ are larger than all transition to $n =2$. 
- All the transition down to $n=2$ are larger than all transition to $n= 3$
- Transition to Lyman series all produce photons of ultraviolet radiation
- Balmer series produce visible light
- Paschen produce infrared radiation
- Discrete energy levels of hydrogen can be predicted by:
#### $$ \text{energy levels of hydrogen}\ E = \dfrac {-13.6}{n^2}eV$$
- $n$ - principle quantum number 
- based on empirical not theory 
- **Bohr model** - has electrons orbiting around the nucleus due to the centripetal force provided by electric attraction between opposite charges.
	- Restricted orbits to certain distances from the nucleus -meaning they did not emit electromagnetic radiation, lose energy and spiral inwards.
	- Learned in [[D.3 Motion in Electromagnet Fields]]
- Photons were emitted or absorbed when electrons moved between these energy levels.
- Bohr showed that:
#### $$mvr = \dfrac {nh}{2\pi}$$
- $r$ - quantized radii
- $m$ - mass of electron
- $v$  - speed of electron
- $n$ - principle quantum number
- $h$ - plank's constant 
- $mvr$ - angular momentum - $L$
- Bohr model combined whit classical physics of circular motion and force of electric attraction with quantum concepts in order to predict the radii of orbits and the energy levels in hydrogen atoms 
---
- equating centripetal force and force on electron with the change of electron $e$ :
$$ \dfrac {mv^2}r = \dfrac {kee}{r^2}$$
$$\therefore v = \sqrt{\dfrac {ke^2}{mr}}$$
- putting this equation for angular momentum 
$$\sqrt{ke^2mr} = \dfrac {nh}{2\pi}$$
- and rearranging for $r$ 
$$r = \dfrac {n^2h^2}{4\pi^2ke^2m}$$
- putting the various values of $n$ lets us predict the radii of possible electron orbits within the hydrogen atom
- total energy of the atom can be calculated
- $E_{total}$ = $E_k$ of electron + $E_k$ of proton + electric potential energy.
	- assuming the electron is orbiting at speed $v$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$ around a proton which is effectively stationary:
#### $$\text{total energy of a hydrogen atom},\ E_{total} = \dfrac 12 mv^2 + \left(- \dfrac {ke^2}r\right)$$
- $e$ - elementary charge
- $v$ - velocity of electron
- $r$ - radius or orbit
- $k$ - coulomb's constant
---
but we know that 
$\dfrac {mv^2}r = \dfrac {ke^2}{r^2}$ or $mv^2 = \dfrac {ke^2}r$
leading to:
#### $$E_{total} = -\dfrac 12 \dfrac{ke^2}r$$
- Bohr's model was worse as predicting atoms containing more electrons.
