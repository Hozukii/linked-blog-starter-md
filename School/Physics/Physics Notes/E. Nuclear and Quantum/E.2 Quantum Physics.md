# The photoelectric effect 
- **Photoelectric effect** - Ejection of electrons from a substance by incident electromagnetic radiation
	- when electromagnetic radiation is directed onto a clean surface of some metals, electrons may be ejected.
	- **photoelectrons** - ejected electrons
- Planck proposed that light and other electromagnetic radiation consisted of individual bundles of energy, thereby explaining the photoelectric effect
#### Why photoelectron s are emitted under some circumstances

Experiment:
- Ultraviolet radiation is shone onto a zinc plate attached to a coulombmeter(measures small charge)
- Ultraviolet causes the zinc plate to become positively charged because some negatively charged electrons on the zinc plate have gained KE to escape from the surface
Investigation of the photoelectric effect show important observations
- If the intensity of radiation is increased, the charge on the plate increases more quickly since more electrons are released
- There is no time delay between the radiation reaching the metal surface and the emission of photoelectrons
- The photoelectric effect can only occur at a certain frequency higher than the threshold frequency
	- **threshold frequency**, $f_0$ - the minimum frequency of a photon that can eject a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
- Different metals have different threshold frequencies
- The photoelectrons emitted from a particular metal by monochromatic radiation of a know frequency have a range of kinetic energies, up to a well-defined maximum
