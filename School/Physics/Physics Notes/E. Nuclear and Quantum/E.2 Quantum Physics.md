# The photoelectric effect 
- **Photoelectric effect** - Ejection of electrons from a substance by incident electromagnetic radiation
	- when electromagnetic radiation is directed onto a clean surface of some metals, electrons may be ejected.
	- **photoelectrons** - ejected electrons
- Planck proposed that light and other electromagnetic radiation consisted of individual bundles of energy, thereby explaining the photoelectric effect
#### Why photoelectron s are emitted under some circumstances

Experiment:
- Ultraviolet radiation is shone onto a zinc plate attached to a coulombmeter(measures small charge)
- Ultraviolet causes the zinc plate to become positively charged because some negatively charged electrons on the zinc plate have gained KE to escape from the surface
Investigation of the photoelectric effect show important observations
- If the intensity of radiation is increased, the charge on the plate increases more quickly since more electrons are released
- There is no time delay between the radiation reaching the metal surface and the emission of photoelectrons
- The photoelectric effect can only occur at a certain frequency higher than the threshold frequency
	- **threshold frequency**, $f_0$ - the minimum frequency of a photon that can eject a photoelectron from the surface of a metal
- Different metals have different threshold frequencies
- The photoelectrons emitted from a particular metal by monochromatic radiation of a know frequency have a range of kinetic energies, up to a well-defined maximum
## Explaining the photoelectric effect: the Einstein model
- The Einstein model explains the photoelectric effect using the concept of photons
- When a photon interacts with an electron, it transfers all its energy. 
	- singe  photon interacts with a single electron and the transfer of energy is instantaneous
- If a photoelectric effect is occurring, increasing the intensity of the radiation only increases the number of photons and photoelectrons, not their individual energies
- Energy carried by photon = work done in removing the electron from the surface + kinetic energy of photoelectron 
	- But energy to required to remove different electrons from the same surface is not always the same.
	- Electrons closer to the surface will require less energy to remove them.
	- However:
- **work function**, $\phi$ - The minimum amount of energy required to free an electron from the attraction of ions in a metal's surface
	- Different for different surfaces
- If $hf < \phi$ 
	- The photoelectric effect cannot occur
- If $hf > \phi$ 
	- The photoelectric effect occurs. Photoelectrons produced by different photons will have a range of different kinetic energies because different amounts of work will have been done to release them
- **Photelectric equation** - The maximum kinetic energy of an emitted photoelectron. 
#### $$E_{max} = hf - \phi$$
Remember that $\phi$ = $hf_0$

- From the graph we can deduce that:
- The gradient is the Plankc's constant 
- The x-intercept is the threshold frequency
- A value for the work can be determined from: when $E_{max} = 0$ 
## Experiments to test the Einstein model 
### Investigating stopping voltages (potential differences)
- It is necessary to determine the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted under a variety of different circumstances.
- In order to do this the kinetic energy must be transferred to another form (measurable) of energy.

![[Pasted image 20240919183914.png|300]]
- Kinetic energy of the photoelectrons can be transferred to electrical potential energy if they are repelled by a negative voltage.
- Ideally a monochromatic radiation should be use but narrow range of frequencies are fine
- Any photoelectrons that have enough kinetic energy will be able to move across the tube and reach the other electrode, the anode. 
- The tube is evacuated so that  electrons do not collide with air molecules.
- The variable potential difference is connected in reverse. 
	- there is negative voltage on the anode that will repel the photoelectrons. 
	- Photoelectrons moving towards the anode will have their kinetic energy reduced as it is transferred to electrical potential energy
- When the reverse voltage on the anode is increased, more photoelectrons will b e prevented from reaching the anode decreasing the current.
- Eventually, the reverse potential difference will be large enough to stop even the most energetic of photoelectrons, and current will fall to 0
- **Stopping voltage**,$V_s$ - the minimum voltage required to reduce a photoelectric current to zero 
- Since $V = \dfrac EQ = \dfrac {\text{energy}}{\text{charge}}$ and $Q = e$
#### $$E_{max} = eV_s$$
### Investigating photoelectric currents
- Using a similar setup we can investigate the effects on the photoelectric current of changing the: 
	- intensity 
	- frequency 
	- metal used in the cathode
##### Intensity
![[Pasted image 20240919184059.png|300]]
- For positive p.d.s, the photoelectric currents remain constant since the kinetic energy does not change meaning the amount of energy each electron has does not change
- For photoelectric currents, it increases as intensity increases (of the same frequency) because there are more photons releasing more photoelectrons. 
- Because the maximum kinetic energy of photons depends only on and work function, but not intensity, all these graphs have the same value for stopping voltage, $V_s$
##### Frequency
![[Pasted image 20240919185654.png|300]]
- Shows photoelectric currents produced by radiation from two monochromatic sources of different frequencies, A and B, incident on the same metal 
- Individual photons in radiation A must have more energy and produce photoelectrons with a higher maximum kinetic energy 
# The wave nature of matter
- **de Broglie's hypothesis** -  All moving particles have wave-like properties 
#### $$ \text {wavelength of a moving particle,}\lambda = \dfrac hp$$
- $h$ - Planck's constant
- $p$ - momentum 
- moving particle is inversely proportional to its momentum.
- Planck's constant shows us that wove properties of particles are only significant for those with tiny momenta
## Evidence for the wave nature of matter 
- Superposition (interference and diffraction) is behaviour that is characteristic of waves, but not particles
- In order to verify de Broglie's hypothesis, it was necessary to observe and measure the diffraction of a beam of particles (electrons)
- In [[C.3 Wave Phenomena]] we have seen that diffraction of light by a diffraction grating can be represented by the equation $n \lambda = d \sin \theta$
- In principle, other electromagnetic waves can be diffracted into patterns. 
- **Davidsson-Germer experiment** - Experiment that verified the wave properties of matter by showing that a beam of electron is diffracted by a crystal (at an angle dependent upon the velocity of the electrons)
- Since -rays' wavelength is comparable to the separations of atoms / ions. this is the necessary condition for significant diffraction effects .
  ![[Pasted image 20240919194523.png|300]]
- When x-rays are diffracted by parallel layers of atoms /ions in a crystal, knowledge of $n$, $\lambda$ and $\theta$ can lead to a determination of $d$, the separation of the layers.
- De Broglie's hypothesis proposed that electrons can have wavelengths similar to x-rays.
![[Pasted image 20240919194540.png|300]]
- A scatted beam of electrons was detected at an angle which confirmed that diffraction was occurring of electron waves with a wavelength consistent with de Broglie's hypothesis.
![[Pasted image 20240919194558.png|400]]
- Type of modern apparatus used to demonstrate the diffraction of electrons.
- two rings are seen, representing constructive interference of electron waves. 
## Wave-particle duality
- **wane-particle duality** - In theory, all particles have wave properties and all electromagnetic waves have particle (photon) properties. 
# Compton scattering 
- **Compton effect (scattering)** - The increase in wavelength (decrease in energy) of high-frequency photons when they interact with electrons
	- important evidence for the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation
- The laws of conservation of energy and momentum can be applied to the scattering.
- The electron gains kinetic energy, so the photon must lose energy. 
- Since for X-ray photon, $E = hf$, if it loses energy, it must change to a smaller frequency.
- Applying the laws of conservation of momentum and energy leads to the following equation which accurately predicts the change in wavelength, $\Delta \lambda$ ,f photons (don't need to know how the equation is derived)
#### $$ \text {compton scattering equation:} \ \lambda_f - \lambda_i = \Delta \lambda = \dfrac h{m_ec}(1-\cos \theta)$$
- $\theta$ - scattering angle
- $m_e$ - mass of the electron
- the electron is assumed to be effectively stationary before being scattered. 
- Interestingly, the change of wavelength in Compton depends only on the scattering angle, it does not depend on the energy, or wavelength of the incident photon. 
- The change in wavelength is relatively small.
