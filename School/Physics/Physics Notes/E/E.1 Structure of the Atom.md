- **Subatomic particle** - Any particle contained within an atom
- The old model was the [[plum pudding model]]
## Geiger-Marsden-Rutherford experiment 
- They directed a beam of positive charged alpha particles from radium at very thin gold foil. 
- A zinc sulfide detector was moved in a circle around the foil to determine the direction in which alpha particles travelled after striking the foil . 
- Gold foil can be made very thin and the foil may may then only have about 6000 layers of atoms. 
- The Geiger and Marsden's results reported that:
	- Most alpha particles passed through the foil
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1800) were deviated through an angle of more than about $10 \degree$
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1000) were deflected through an angle larger than $90\degree$
- The mass of an atom is concentrated in a small volume at the centre
	- Since most passes through
- The nucleus must be positively charged in order to repel the positively charged alpha particles 
- From the experiments he calculated that diameter of:
	- gold nucleus was in order of $10^{-14}m$
	- the whole atom was in order of $10^{-10}m$
## Composition of the nucleus
- The electrons orbit the nucleus because of the centripetal force provided by the electrical attraction between opposite charged.
