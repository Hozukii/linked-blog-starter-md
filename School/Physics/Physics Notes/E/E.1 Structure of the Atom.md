- **Subatomic particle** - Any particle contained within an atom
- The old model was the [[plum pudding model]]
## Geiger-Marsden-Rutherford experiment 
- They directed a beam of positive charged alpha particles from radium at very thin gold foil. 
- A zinc sulfide detector was moved in a circle around the foil to determine the direction in which alpha particles travelled after striking the foil . 
- Gold foil can be made very thin and the foil may may then only have about 6000 layers of atoms.

- The Geiger and Marsden's results reported that:
	- Most alpha particles passed through the foil
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1800) were deviated through an angle of more than about $10 \degree$
	- A small number of particles (about 1 in 1000) were deflected through an angle larger than $90\degree$

- The mass of an atom is concentrated in a small volume at the centre
	- Since most passes through
- The nucleus must be positively charged in order to repel the positively charged alpha particles 
- From the experiments he calculated that diameter of:
	- gold nucleus was in order of $10^{-14}m$
	- the whole atom was in order of $10^{-10}m$
## Composition of the nucleus
- The electrons orbit the nucleus because of the centripetal force provided by the electrical attraction between opposite charged. 

| Name of particle | approximate relative mass | relative charge |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| proton           | 1                         | +1              |
| neutron          | 1                         | 0               |
| eletron          | $\frac 1 {1840}$          | -1              |

### What holds the nucleus together? 
- There is a large repulsive force between protons:
$$F = k \dfrac {q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
$F = \dfrac {(8.99\cdot 10^9)\cdot(1.60 \cdot 10^{-16})}{(6 \cdot 10^{-15})^2} \approx 10N$
- To oppose this repulsive force, we know there is a very short-range strong nuclear force. (detail knowledge not required in IB) 
- **Strong nuclear force** - Fundamental force that is responsible for attracting nucleons together. It is a short-range attractive force (range about $10^{-15}m$) but for smaller distances, it is repulsive, and hence it also prevents a nucleus from collapsing
- **Nucleon** - A particle in a nucleus (proton or neutron)
- **Proton number**, $Z$, - number of proton in a nucleus of an atom 
	- Atoms of particular element are identified by their proton number (also called atomic number)
- **Nucleon number**, $A$ - defined as the total number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus
	- represents the mass of the atom since electrons are (almost) negligible
- **Neutron number**,$N$ - number of neutrons in a nucleus
	- similar to the number of protons, although the ratio of $\dfrac {neutron}{proton}$ generally increases with increasing proton number. 
## Nuclear notation
- **Nuclide** - term used to identify one particular species (type) of atom, as defined by the structure its nucleus. 
	- A *radionuclide* is unstable and will emit radiation
- All with the same proton and nucleon number are described as the same nuclide.

### Isotopes
- **Isotope** - One of two or more atoms different nuclides of the same elements 
- For example:
	- Most common isotope of hydrogen is hydrogen-1 $\ce {^1_1 H}$
	- Hydrogen-2 $\ce{^2_1H}$ is called deuterium
	- Hydrogen-3 $\ce{^3_1H}$ is called tritium
	- Hydrogen isotopes are involved in nucleur fusion reactions

- Samples of elements often have mixtures of isotopes. They can't be chemically separated. 
- Separation can only achieved by processes that depend on mass. For example, diffusion rate of gaseous compounds. 
- **Diffusion** - Random movement of particles from a place of high concentration to place s of lower concentration. 
- The notation for nuclides can also be applied to the nucleons:
	- e.g $^1_1p$, $^1_0n$, $\ce{^0_{-1}e}$
