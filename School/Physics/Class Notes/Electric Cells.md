- Terminal potential
- $\varepsilon = I (R + r)$
## Chemical cell
- To make a chemical cell, or a battery, you can begin with a container of weak acid, and two electrodes made of different materials
- Different metals dissolve ain acids at different rates
- When a metal dissolves ,it enters the acid as positive ion, leaving behind an electron. 
- The weak acid is the **electrolyte**
- least negative metal is the **positive terminal**
- The most negative metal is the **negative terminal**
- A primary cell can't be recharged
- A secondary cell can be recharged by applying an external voltage, reversing the chemical reaction
