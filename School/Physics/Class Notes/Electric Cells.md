- Terminal potential
- $\varepsilon = I (R + r)$
## Chemical cell
- To make a chemical cell, or a battery, you can begin with a container of weak acid, and two electrodes made of different materials
- Different metals dissolve ain acids at different rates
- When a metal dissolves ,it enters the acid as positive ion, leaving behind an electron. 
- The weak acid is the **electrolyte**
- least negative metal is the **positive terminal**
- The most negative metal is the **negative terminal**
- A primary cell can't be recharged
- A secondary cell can be recharged by applying an external voltage, reversing the chemical reaction
- $\Delta V = \Delta E_p /q$
## electromotive force
- The **Electromotive force** $\varepsilon$ (emf) of a cell is the amount of chemical energy converted to electrical energy per unit charge
- Since energy per unit charge is volts, emf is measured in volts
- There is a difference between unloaded and loaded.
