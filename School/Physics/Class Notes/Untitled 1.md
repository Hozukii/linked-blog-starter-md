Ontario has implemented a system of tradable permits, also known as cap and trade (C&T), to reduce carbon
emissions. The intervention is being criticized by some business groups, who want the implementation to be
delayed, with concerns about its impact on firms and households.

The tradable permits system is being used because goods such as natural gas have negative externalities of
production (the extra cost imposed on someone other than the producer or consumer) in the form of
greenhouse gas pollution. Assuming that the only externality is for production, this can be modelled below,
where the marginal external cost is represented by length a. This means that the marginal social cost (MSC) is
higher than the marginal private cost (MPC), which is the firm’s cost and is therefore natural gas’s supply
curve.

In the free market, with no government intervention, the output of natural gas will be Qm, where supply is
equal to demand, represented by marginal private benefit (MPB). At the point Qm, MSC is greater than
marginal social benefit (MSB) and creates the welfare loss of area c, meaning that, for maximum community
surplus, less of the good should be produced. Q* is the allocatively efficient point where MSB is equal to
MSC, resulting in no welfare loss.
