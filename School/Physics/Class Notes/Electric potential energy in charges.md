- **Electric potential energy** - the work done to bring a charge(q) from infinity to a point in space in the presence of an electric field created by another charge. 
	- It represents the potential energy stored due to the relative positions of two charges
### $$E_p = \dfrac {kq_1q_2}r$$
## Coulomb's constant
