- **Electric potential energy** - the work done to bring a charge(q) from infinity to a point in space in the presence of an electric field created by another charge. 
	- It represents the potential energy stored due to the relative positions of two charges
### $$E_p = \dfrac {kq_1q_2}r$$
## Coulomb's constant 
- Coulmob's law also governs the electric potential energy, which describes how the potential energy is directly proportionally to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the difference between the m .The theory predicts that like charge repel and unlike charges attract each other. 
- There are abvious differences that need to be discussed - force is inversely proportional to the sequare of the distance between the charges where electric potential is proportional to the actual distance. 
- This force in invesly proportional to the square of the distance because the electric field emanates in three dimensions from a point charge, and the intensity of the field spreads out over the surface of a sphere. As you get further from the charge, the area over which the field spreads increase as the squar of the distance, hence the force decreases with the square of the distance. 
- Energy is inversely proportional to the distance, not the square of the distance. This is because energy is related to the work done in moving a charge within an electric field. When calculating work, you integrate the force over the distance moved. When integrating the Coulomb force with respect to distance, you get a relationship that is $\propto$ 1/r for energy.
