### $$\varepsilon = Bvl$$
### $$V = BvL$$

- We need to be able to show that the emf $\varepsilon$ induced in a straight conductor of length $l$ moving at velocity $v$ through a magnetic field of strength $B$ 
- Where v and B are perpendicular
- since $F = qvB$, and $E = \dfrac Vd$ , and $F = Eq$ 
- $\therefore E= vB$ 
- $V = BvL$
