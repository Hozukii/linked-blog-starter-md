#### $$n \lambda = d \space sin \theta$$

- This phenomena is enhanced when $\lambda \approx$ aperture (the size of the gap)

$n$ = $n^{th}$ bright spot from the central bright spot
$\lambda$ = wavelength in (m)
$d$ = distance between slits
$sin\theta$ = distance to central bright spot to the distance to "n"
