- **Standing wave** - Wave that remains in a constant position. 
- Unlike travelling waves, which move through a medium, standing waves appear to be stationary.
## Formation of standing waves
- Standing waves for through the process of interference 
- When two waves of the same frequency and amplitude travel in opposite direction and meet, they superimpose. 
- This creates points of no displacement, called nodes, and points of maximum displacement , called anti-nodes 
- Although not in the databooklet: $y(x,t) = 2A cos \space (kx) \ sin \ (\omega t)$
- $y(x,t)$ - displacement at position x and time t
- $A$ the amplitude
- $k$ the wave number
- $\omega$ - angular frequency
- it's just handy to know. 
## Characteristics of standing waves
### with ropes

- Nodes: points where there is no movement (displacement is zero)
- Anti-nodes: Points where the displacement is maximum
- wavelength ($\lambda$) : The distance between two consecutive nodes
- Eq: For string of length $L$, fix at both ends, the the wavelength of the standing waves are given by: $\lambda_n = \dfrac {2L}n$
	- n - the amount of harmonic
### In pipes
- Standing waves can also form in air column within pipes, which can be either closed or open
- Closed pipe: A pipe closed at one end 
- Open pipe: A pipe open at both ends
- Eq: for closed pope, the wovelength of the standing waves are given by:
	- $\lambda_n = \dfrac {4L} {2n - 1}$ 
- For open wave: 
	- $\lambda_n = \dfrac {2L}n$
