- **Torque** - the ability of a force to rotate an object. 
#### $$ \tau = F \cdot \sin {\theta}$$


- $\tau$ - torque , measured in newton meters
- $F$ - the lever arm or the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the line of action of the force, measured in meters $m$ 
- $r$ - lever or the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation
- $\theta$ - angle between force vector and lever arm

- How is torque affecting you?
	- Torque is generated when a force is applied at a distance from a poviot point , and it causes rotational motion around that point
	- The effectiveness of the force in causing rotation depends on the angle $\theta$ between the force and the lever arm. Maximum torque is achieved when $\theta = 90 \degree$ 
## Dynamic equilibrium 
- **Dynamic equilibrium** - the torque due to difference forces balance each other out. 
# SHM
- **SHM** : in systems like a pendulum, torque is responsible for restoring the force that brings the pendulum back.
## Couples 
- **Couple**- a pair of parallel forces of equal magnitude but with different lines of action and acting in opposite direction
#### $$ \tau = 2 F r \sin {\theta}$$
