# Kepler's three laws of planetary movement
1. Kepler's first law: planets move in ellipses, ith the sun at one focus
2. Kepler's second law: the line between the Sun and the planet sweep sout equal areas in equal time 
3. Kepler's third law : $T^2 \propto r^3$, 
	1. $T$ - the period
	2. $r$ - average distance from the sun
