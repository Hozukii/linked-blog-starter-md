# Wave behaviour
## Reflection and refraction
#### Wavefronts
- Wavefronts are perpendicular to the wave

- Flat or straight wavefront

- Circular wavefront

- During reflection, the frequency and the wavelength of the wave *do not change*

## Refraction
**Refraction** - occurs when a wave meets a boundary, such as a solid object, or a change in the medium, and is at least partially allowed through the boundary.
