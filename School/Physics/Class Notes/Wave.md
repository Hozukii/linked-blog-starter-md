# Wave behaviour
## Reflection and refraction
#### Wavefronts
- Wavefronts are perpendicular to the wave

- Flat or straight wavefront

- Circular wavefront

- During reflection, the frequency and the wavelength of the wave *do not change*

## Refraction
**Refraction** - occurs when a wave meets a boundary, such as a solid object, or a change in the medium, and is at least partially allowed through the boundary. 
- Wavelength changes
- Frequency does not 
- speed changes

## Snell's law
#### $$n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$$

#### Snell's law for refracted waves

#### $$\dfrac {v_2} {v_1} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1}$$

### Refractive index
- A **refractive index** $n_m$ is often used when dealing with light waves. 
#### $$n_m = \dfrac c {v_m}$$
### Total internal reflection
- When a wave moving in an optically dense region arrives at a boundary with a less dense medium it is possible to have all of the light reflected - trapping it inside. This is the principle behind fiber optics. 
- The **critical angle** $\theta_c$ is that incident angle at which the angle of refraction is $\theta_{refr}$ is $90\degree$ 
#### $$sin \theta_c = \dfrac {n_2}{n_1}$$
### Diffraction through a single-slit and around object
- If a wave meets a hole in a wall that is of comparable size to its wavelength, the wave will be bent through a process called **diffraction**
- If the aperture is much larger than the wavelength, diffraction will be minimal to non-existent
- Diffraction is caused by objects within the medium that interact with the wave 
- it is caused by two mediums and their boundary
## Christian Huygens' principle
- Every point on a wavefront emits a spherical wavelet at the same velocity and wavelength as the oiginal
## Path difference 
- Two coherent wave sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ will show the following 
#### $$ \text {path difference} = s \lambda$$
- If $n$ is integer then it is constructive 
- if $n$ is non-integer it is destructive
