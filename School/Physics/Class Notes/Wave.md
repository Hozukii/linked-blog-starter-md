# Wave behaviour
## Reflection and refraction
#### Wavefronts
- Wavefronts are perpendicular to the wave

- Flat or straight wavefront

- Circular wavefront

- During reflection, the frequency and the wavelength of the wave *do not change*

## Refraction
**Refraction** - occurs when a wave meets a boundary, such as a solid object, or a change in the medium, and is at least partially allowed through the boundary. 
- Wavelength changes
- Frequency does not 
- speed changes

## Snell's law
#### $$n_{1}\sin\theta_{1}=n_{2}\sin\theta_{2}$$

#### Snell's law for refracted waves

#### $$\dfrac {v_2} {v_1} = \dfrac {sin\theta_2}{sin\theta_1}$$

### Refractive index
- A **refractive index** $n_m$ is often used when dealing with light waves. 
#### $$n_m = \dfrac c {v_m}$$
