#### $$\varepsilon = -N\dfrac {\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$
- $\varepsilon$ - induced electromotive force (emf) in volts (V)
- N - Number of turns in the coil 
- $\Delta \Phi$ - Change in magnetic flux through the coil in webers (Wb)
- $\Delta t$ - time over which the change occurs in seconds (s)
## What the Flux?
#### $$\Phi = BAcos\theta$$
- $\Phi$ - magnetic flux, measured in Weber(Wb)
- $B$ - Magnetic Field Strength, measured in Tesla ($T$)
- $A$ - Area, measured in square meter($m^2$)
