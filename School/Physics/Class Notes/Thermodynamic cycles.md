- Work is force x distance
- So in a gas, what is the force
- Force when discussing an ideal gas is pressure (P) F/A
- So then $W = \dfrac{F}{A \cdot d}$
- d is the volume
- **Isobaric** - pressure is remaining constant
- The volume will change when force is applied because the gas will expand.
- Therefore $W = P\Delta V$ 
- $\Delta V$ - Change in volume
- **Isovolumetric** - constant volume
- **isothermal** - constant temperature
#### Adiabatic
- An adiabatic process in one in which no heat is transferred into or out of teh system
- Work done on or by the system changes its internal energy, which can lead to changes in temperature eventually
- In an adiabatic compression, the temperature rises
- adiabatic expansion - the temperature falls, without any heat being exchanged with the environment
## Thermodynamic cycles
- A fixed quantity of a gas undergoes a cycle by changing between the following three states
- State A: 
- State B:
- State C:
## Ideal gas vs real gas
PV = nRT describes the behaviour of real gas only *Low pressures and large volumes*

# Zeroth law of thermodynamics 
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilirium
# First law of Thermodynamics
$\Delta U = Q - W$ , where $\Delta U$ is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system and W is the work done by the system.
$$Q = \Delta U + W$$
# Second law of thermodynamics
- The entropy of any isolated system always increases. Heat cannot spontaneously flow from a cooler location to a hotter location. 
# Third law of Thermodynamics 
- The entropy of a system approaches a constant value as the temperature approaches absolute zero
