- Electric currents produce a magnetic field
	- This extend to all charges
- A moving magnetic field produces a current. 
# D.3 Motion in electromagnetic field

$F = qvBsin\theta$ 
$F = BILsin\theta$
$\dfrac FL = \dfrac{\mu_0I_1I_2}{2\pi r}$
# Lorentz force law 
- Describes the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. 
$$F = qvBsin\theta$$
F - force in $N$
$q$ - charge in coulombs
$v$ is velocity in $ms^{-1}$
B - magnetic field strength in Teslas(T)
$\theta$ angle between the velocity vector of the charged particle and the magnetic field.
- if a particle charge ($q$) moves with a velocity ($v$) in the presence of an electric field ($E$) and a magnetic field ($B$), then it will experience a force 
- This is simply because a moving charge creates a magnetic field
- Therefore, magnetic field inside another magnetic field will feel a force
- We represent the feeling this force with the Right hand slap rule
- Fingers in the direction of the magnetic field, thumb in the direction of the movement and the palm as the direction of force being applied. 
- **This only works in conventional current**
- For any given situation, if only one of these fields is non-zero, the formula simplifies. If ($E$) is non-zero and ($B$) is zero, the formula becomes ($E = qE$) and we have the simple eelectrostatic force. If ($E$) is zero and ($B$) is non-zero, the formula becomes ($F = qvBsin\theta$) , which is the formula for the magnetic force. This is why the Lorentz force is given by ... 
$$F = qE + qvBsin\theta$$
# BIL Law (alternate Lorentz law)
$$F = BILsin\theta$$
F - magnetic force acting on the conductor, measured in N
B - magnetic flux density of the field, measured in Tesla
I - Current flowing through the conductor, measured in meters
$\theta$ - angle between the conductor and the magnetic field lines, measured in degrees. 
- fundamental equation in electromagnetism 
- Is the force equation on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field with magnetic flux density
- The maximum force occurs when the conductor is perpendicular to the field
