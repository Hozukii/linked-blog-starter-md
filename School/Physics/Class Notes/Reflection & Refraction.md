- Refraction - the bending of light or waves
	- When a wave enters a different medium to the incident, refraction occurs
- From an optically less dense medium to an optically more dense medium, waves always refract towards the normal
- From a more dense medium to a less dense medium ray refract away from the normal. 
	- At some stage the ray will reach $90\degree$ to the normal: This is where **total internal reflection** occurs
