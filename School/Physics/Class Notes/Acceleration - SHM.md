- **Simple harmonic motion**:
	- Restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement
	- Acts in the opposite direction to that of displacement
- SHM model assumes no energy loss due to friction, air resistance, or other non-conservative forces
#### $$ a = - \omega^2 x$$
- $a$ - acceleratin
- $x$ - displacement from the equilibrium
- $\omega$ angular frequency
- negative acceleration is directed towards the equilibrium position
- because velocity and acceleration are related (linearly) they're also related in SHM:
#### $$v_{max} = \omega A$$
- $A$ - maximum displacement/ amplitude
