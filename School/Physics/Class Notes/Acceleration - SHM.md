- **Simple harmonic motion**:
	- Restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement
	- Acts in the opposite direction to that of displacement
- SHM model assumes no energy loss due to friction, air resistance, or other non-conservative forces
#### $$ a = - \omega^2 x$$
- $a$ - acceleratin
- $x$ - displacement from the equilibrium
- $\omega$ angular frequency
- negative acceleration is directed towards the equilibrium position
- because velocity and acceleration are related (linearly) they're also related in SHM:
#### $$v_{max} = \omega A$$
- $A$ - maximum displacement/ amplitude
#### $$ x = x_0 \space sin(\omega t + \phi)$$
#### $$v = \omega x_0 \space cos (\omega t + \phi)$$
#### $$ v = \pm \sqrt{(x_0)^2 - x^2}$$
- $x$ - displacement 
- $v$ - velocity
- $x_0$ - amplitude
- $\phi$ - phase constant, determines where in its cycle the motion begins if $\phi = 0$, the motion starts at $x= 0$ and moves in the positive direction
- $\omega$ - angular frequency
