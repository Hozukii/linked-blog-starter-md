### $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac lg}$$

# Simple Harmonic motion 

## Restoring Force
- **Restoring Force** - When our object strays from the mean position, a restoring force steps in. 
- The restoring force always faces towards the equilibrium position regardless of the position or direction of the object in simple harmonic motion. 
- **Proportional dance** - The restoring force is a gentle guide, always proportional to how far our object wandered. If it strays more, the force gets stronger; if it's close, the force eases up. 
- **Directional tango** - The restoring force always points toward the mean position.
## Velocity and acceeration 
- Velocity is highest when the object is monig through the equilibrium ponit. 
- Velocity is the slowest at maximum amplitudes
- Acceleration is always the highest at the maximum amplitudes when the obect is changing directions 
- Acceleration is always the slowest at the equilibrium points 

## Amplitude

- The maximum amplitude is the distance the object reaches furthest from the equilibrium point 
- The amplitude is any distance from the equilibrium point and can be positive or negative depending on which convention you're using from the equilibrium point. 

## Pendulums

- A pendulum moves in a simple harmonic motion 
- It has a period in seconds
- It has a frequency in $Hz$ or $s^{-1}$
#### $$T = 2\pi \sqrt{\dfrac lg}$$
- $l$ - Length 
- $g$ - Gravity
