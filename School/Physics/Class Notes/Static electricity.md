- **Charge** - property of elementary particles that make up everything else 
- Two charged objects produce an electrical force that depends on the product of their charges and, like gravity .the force diminishes as a function of the inverse square of their separation
- Electrical force is 1036x stronger than the gravitational force
- Charge is measured by Coulomb 
- 1 charge is $1.602 \cdot 10^{-19}$
## Coulomb's law
- **Coulomb's law** - the magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion betwee two point charges is directly proportional to the rpoduct of the magnitudes of charges and inversly proportional to the square of teh distance between them.
- In symbols:
- $F_{electric} = k(\dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2})$
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of charges
- $r$ is their separation
- $k$ is a constant. It determines the force unit from the unit of charge during calculations, and $k$ also depends on the material between the objects. 
- if that material is a vacuum :
	- $8.99 \cdot 10^9 Nm^2C^{-2}$
- $k = \dfrac 1 {4\pi \varepsilon_0}$
- permittivity - It characterizes the tendency of the atomic charge in an insulating material to distort in the presence of an electric field
