z - **Charge** - property of elementary particles that make up everything else 
- Two charged objects produce an electrical force that depends on the product of their charges and, like gravity .the force diminishes as a function of the inverse square of their separation
- Electrical force is 1036x stronger than the gravitational force
- Charge is measured by Coulomb 
- 1 charge is $1.602 \cdot 10^{-19}$
## Coulomb's law
- **Coulomb's law** - the magnitude of the electrostatic force of attraction or repulsion betwee two point charges is directly proportional to the rpoduct of the magnitudes of charges and inversly proportional to the square of teh distance between them.
- In symbols:
- $F_{electric} = k(\dfrac{q_1q_2}{r^2})$
- $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the magnitudes of charges
- $r$ is their separation
- $k$ is a constant(coulomb's constant). It determines the force unit from the unit of charge during calculations, and $k$ also depends on the material between the objects. 
- if that material is a vacuum :
	- $8.99 \cdot 10^9 Nm^2C^{-2}$
- $k = \dfrac 1 {4\pi \varepsilon_0}$
- permittivity - It characterizes the tendency of the atomic charge in an insulating material to distort in the presence of an electric field
- **electric field** - region around a charged particle or object within which a force would be exerted on other charged particles or object s The strength of this field is proportional to the electric charge that creates it and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge. 
- Every charged object creates an electric field that extends indefinitely in space.
- The direction of the electric field is defined as the direction that a positive test charge would over if placed in the field. 
- Electric field lines begin on positive charges ad end on negative charges, with the density of lines representing the strength of the field 
- Coulomb's law only applies to a pair of point charges . It cannot be used to directly to calculate the force between charges distributed through and on irregularly-shaped electrical conductors or insulators, or between parallel metal plates. 

## Electric field equations
$E = \dfrac Fq = \dfrac Vd$
- **Electric field strength** - the magnitude of the force per unit charge on an infinitesimal positive test charge placed in the field.
