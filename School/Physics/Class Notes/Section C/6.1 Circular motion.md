$$ v = \omega r$$
$$ a = \dfrac {v^2}r = \dfrac {4\pi ^2 r}{T^2}$$
$$ F = \dfrac {mv^2}{r} = m\omega ^2 r$$
### Centripetal force and acceleration 

- **uniform circular motion** - traveling in a circle (or arc) with constant speed $v$
- Velocity is always tangent to the circle 
- Magnitude of velocity does not change
- Direction of the velocity vector changes
- there is acceleration, even though the speed is not changing. 
- **Centripetal force**, $F_c$ :
$$F_c = ma_c$$
