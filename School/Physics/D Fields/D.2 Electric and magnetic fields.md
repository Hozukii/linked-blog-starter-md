# Electric charge
**Charge** - measured in coulombs, C. 
- Proton has a charge of $+1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- Electrons has a charge of  $-1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- Any quantity of charge consists of a whole number of these charged particles, each 
- $1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}C$ is the **elementary charge** and given the symbol $e$
## Electrostatic charging and discharging
- Negatively charged electrons are the outermost particles in atoms and some of them are not tightly bound to atoms. 
- If electrons can be added, or removed from a neutral object, it will have an overall charge and we describe the object as being charged and can result in **electrostatic** effects
- **electrostatics** - the study of the effects of charges at rest(that is, not electric currents).
### Charging by friction
- When friction occurs between substances, electrons are often transferred between their surfaces
- Charging by friction is not limited to solids
	- Example, when liquids flow through pipes, or when air flows past fans. 
### Charging and discharging by contact 
- When objects come in contact with each other, excess electrons, or a deficit of electrons may be shared between them.
- **Discharge** - flow of electrons to or from an object that reduces the overall charge on it
- **Earth(ground connection)** - A good conductor connected between a point on a piece of apparatus and the ground. This may be part of safety measure, or to ensure that they point is kept at 0V
### Charging by electrostatic induction
**Electrostatic induction** - Movement of charged particles caused by the influence of a nearby charged object, but without physical contact.
