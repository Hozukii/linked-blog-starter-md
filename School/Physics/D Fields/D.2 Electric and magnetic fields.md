# Electric charge
**Charge** - measured in coulombs, C. 
- Proton has a charge of $+1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- Electrons has a charge of  $-1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- Any quantity of charge consists of a whole number of these charged particles, each 
- $1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}C$ is the **elementary charge** and given the symbol $e$
## Electrostatic charging and discharging
- Negatively charged electrons are the outermost particles in atoms and some of them are not tightly bound to atoms. 
- If electrons can be added, or removed from a neutral object, it will have an overall charge and we describe the object as being charged and can result in **electrostatic** effects
- **electrostatics** - the study of the effects of charges at rest(that is, not electric currents).
### Charging by friction
- When friction occurs between substances, electrons are often transferred between their surfaces
- Charging by friction is not limited to solids
	- Example, when liquids flow through pipes, or when air flows past fans. 
### Charging and discharging by contact 
- When objects come in contact with each other, excess electrons, or a deficit of electrons may be shared between them.
- **Discharge** - flow of electrons to or from an object that reduces the overall charge on it
- **Earth(ground connection)** - A good conductor connected between a point on a piece of apparatus and the ground. This may be part of safety measure, or to ensure that they point is kept at 0V
### Charging by electrostatic induction
**Electrostatic induction** - Movement of charged particles caused by the influence of a nearby charged object, but without physical contact.

- Electrostatic induction can be the best way to charge an object for an experiment, because it does not involve sharing charge.

#### Dangers of static electricity
- Lightning is an obvious example
- Cars and planes can become charged as they move through the air or along the ground.
# Electric forces: Coulomb's law
- **Coulomb's law** - there is an electric force between two point charges, $q_1$ and $q_2$ separated by a distance $r$ :
## $$F = k\dfrac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
- Charged bodies which are spherical can be considered to act as point charges, so they also obey Coulomb's law
- The constant $k$ is known as the **coulomb constant**. It has the value:
	- $8.99 \cdot 10^9 Nm^2 C^{-2}$
	- $k$ is not a fundamental constant, because it can be further simplified. 
- **Coulomb constant**
	- $k = \dfrac 1{4\pi \varepsilon_0}$
	- $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space
### Permittivity 
- The $\dfrac 1{4\pi}$ in the expression for $k$ represents the radial nature of the force and $\varepsilon_0$ 
- $\varepsilon_0$ is the **permittivity of free space** and has the value :
	$8.85 \cdot 10^{-12}C^2 N^{-1}m^{-2}$
- **Permittivity of free space** - fundamental constant which represents the ability of free space to transfer an electrical force and field
- The **permittivity of a particular medium** $\varepsilon$ :
	- $\text{relative permittivity} = \dfrac{\text{permittivity of medium}}{\text{permittivity of free space}}$ 
	- $\varepsilon_r = \dfrac \varepsilon \varepsilon_0$
# Electric field 
- A region in which a charge would experience an electric force is called an electric field. 
- electric field lines always point in the directions of the forces on positive charges
- The field lines can never cross each other and the field is strongest where the field lines are densest.

- Electric lines must be perpendicular to any conducting surface
- If this was not true, there would be a component of electric force acting on the electrons, so that they would rearrange until the field was perpendicular
### Electric field strength 
- **Electric field strength, E** - the force per unit charge that would be experienced by a small positive test charge placed at that point:
$$E = \dfrac Fq$$
 - An expression for the strength of the constant electric field between parallel plates can be obtained by considering the work done as a charge, $q$ moves from one plate to the other:
- $W = Fd = Vq$ 
- work done = force x distance = potential difference x charge
- SO the electric field strength between parallel metal plates can be arranged into:
- $E = \dfrac Vd$
#### Electric field strength around a point charge
- The strength of an electric field around a point charge decreases with the square of the distance
- $E = \dfrac Eq = \dfrac {kq}{r^2}$
### Combining electric fields 
- Electric fields can be combined to determine a resultant by using vector addition

#### Millikan's experiment
![[Pasted image 20240206170209.png]]
- Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher used this apparatus to determine the small quantities of charge on  oil drops 
- The importance of this famous experiment lies in the fact that:
- The charges of *all* drops were multiples of the same number($-1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}C$)
- millikan's experiment confirms that electric charge is a quantized quantity 
## Magnetic fields around permanent magnets 
- **magnetic forces** - Fundamental forces that act across space between all moving charges, currents, and/ or permanent magnets
- Magnetic fields are produced around all moving charges(currents)
- Any stationary charge has an electric field around it but, if a charge moves, there is also a magnetic field around it. We frequently refer to the combinations as **electromagnetic fields**
- **Ferromagnetic materials** - Materials from which permanent magnets are made
- The magnetism is effectively concentrated at the ends of the bar and these are called **magnetic poles**
- There are only two types of magnetic but they always occur in pairs
	- Magnetic north(N) poles and magnetic south poles (S)
