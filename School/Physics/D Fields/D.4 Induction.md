# Electromagnetic induction
- **induction** - describing something being made to happen without physical contact. 
- Whenever a conductor moves across a magnetic field, or a magnetic field moves across a conductor, an emf will be induced. This effect is called electromagnetic induction. 
# Electromagnetic induction by a conductor moving across a permanent magnetic field

- An emf is induced in a conductor because free electrons experience forces which make them move along the wire as it crosses a magnetic field.

- The charge separation produces a potential difference across the ends of the conductor
## Equation for induced emf 
- The charge separation produces an electric field along the conductor :
#### $$E= \dfrac \varepsilon L$$
- $\varepsilon$ - the induced emf across the ends of the conductor

- The induced emf when a straight conductor moves perpendicularly across a uniform magnetic field:
- $$\varepsilon = BvL$$
## Electromagnetic induction by moving a permanent magnetic field across a conductor
- Moving a conductor through a permanent magnetic field has similar effect to keeping the conductor still and moving the field.

- In the second figure, the effects can be increased greatly by winding the conductor into a solenoid. The direction of the induced current around the induced coil will be reversed if the magnet is reversed, or motion of the magnet is reversed
## Electromagnetic induction without physical movement
- Emfs can also be induced, by changes in the current in one circuit affecting another.

- The sudden change of magnetic field induces an emf and a current. The changing current produces a changing magnetic field in the same way as moving a magnet does. 
- This induced emf/current only lasts for a moment. With alternating currents this effect is continuous. 
# Magnetic flux and magnetic flux linkage
## Magnetic flux
- The size of the induced emf depends not only on the strength of the magnetic filed, $B$ but also on the area, $A$, of the circuit over which it is cating, and the angle, $\theta$, at which it is passing through. 
- Magnetic flux:
#### $$\Phi = BA cos\theta$$
- SI unit: Weber($Wb$) $1Wb = 1Tm^2$
- *Note that the angle $\theta$ is the angle between the field and a normal to the surface, not the angle between the field and the surface*

### Magnetic flux linkage
- This is the case for a single loop of wire. 
- If the wire is wound into a coil with $N$ turns, each turn contributes the same emf, so that the overall induced emf is multiplied by $N$
- **Magnetic flux linkage**:
$$\text{magnetic flux linkage} = N \Phi$$
## Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
- If a coil with $N$ turns experience a magnetic flux which changes by $\Delta \Phi$ in time $\Delta t$, the induced emf:
#### $$\varepsilon = -N\dfrac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$
- It is negative because the induced emf acts to oppose any change in the magnetic flux
### Induction because of motion of a conductor across a uniform magnetic field
