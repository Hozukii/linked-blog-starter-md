# Electromagnetic induction
- **induction** - describing something being made to happen without physical contact. 
- Whenever a conductor moves across a magnetic field, or a magnetic field moves across a conductor, an emf will be induced. This effect is called electromagnetic induction. 
# Electromagnetic induction by a conductor moving across a permanent magnetic field

- An emf is induced in a conductor because free electrons experience forces which make them move along the wire as it crosses a magnetic field.

- The charge separation produces a potential difference across the ends of the conductor
## Equation for induced emf 
- The charge separation produces an electric field along the conductor :
#### $$E= \dfrac \varepsilon L$$
- $\varepsilon$ - the induced emf across the ends of the conductor

- The induced emf when a straight conductor moves perpendicularly across a uniform magnetic field:
- $$\varepsilon = BvL$$
## Electromagnetic induction by moving a permanent magnetic field across a conductor
- Moving a conductor through a permanent magnetic field has similar effect to keeping the conductor still and moving the field.
