# Electromagnetic induction
- **induction** - describing something being made to happen without physical contact. 
- Whenever a conductor moves across a magnetic field, or a magnetic field moves across a conductor, an emf will be induced. This effect is called electromagnetic induction. 
# Electromagnetic induction by a conductor moving across a permanent magnetic field

- An emf is induced in a conductor because free electrons experience forces which make them move along the wire as it crosses a magnetic field. 
- ![[Pasted image 20240214200047.png]]
- The charge separation produces a potential difference across the ends of the conductor
## Equation for induced emf 
- The charge separation produces an electric field along the conductor :
#### $$E= \dfrac \varepsilon L$$
- $\varepsilon$ - the induced emf across the ends of the conductor
![[Pasted image 20240214200353.png|500]]
- The induced emf when a straight conductor moves perpendicularly across a uniform magnetic field:
- $$\varepsilon = BvL$$
## Electromagnetic induction by moving a permanent magnetic field across a conductor
- Moving a conductor through a permanent magnetic field has similar effect to keeping the conductor still and moving the field.

- In the second figure, the effects can be increased greatly by winding the conductor into a solenoid. The direction of the induced current around the induced coil will be reversed if the magnet is reversed, or motion of the magnet is reversed
## Electromagnetic induction without physical movement
- Emfs can also be induced, by changes in the current in one circuit affecting another. 
![[Pasted image 20240221142032.png|350]]
- The sudden change of magnetic field induces an emf and a current. The changing current produces a changing magnetic field in the same way as moving a magnet does. 
- This induced emf/current only lasts for a moment. With alternating currents this effect is continuous. 
# Magnetic flux and magnetic flux linkage
## Magnetic flux
- The size of the induced emf depends not only on the strength of the magnetic filed, $B$ but also on the area, $A$, of the circuit over which it is cating, and the angle, $\theta$, at which it is passing through. 
- Magnetic flux:
#### $$\Phi = BA cos\theta$$
- SI unit: Weber($Wb$) $1Wb = 1Tm^2$
- *Note that the angle $\theta$ is the angle between the field and a normal to the surface, not the angle between the field and the surface*

### Magnetic flux linkage
- This is the case for a single loop of wire. 
- If the wire is wound into a coil with $N$ turns, each turn contributes the same emf, so that the overall induced emf is multiplied by $N$
- **Magnetic flux linkage**:
$$\text{magnetic flux linkage} = N \Phi$$
## Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction
- If a coil with $N$ turns experience a magnetic flux which changes by $\Delta \Phi$ in time $\Delta t$, the induced emf:
#### $$\varepsilon = -N\dfrac{\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$$
- It is negative because the induced emf acts to oppose any change in the magnetic flux
### Induction because of motion of a conductor across a uniform magnetic field
![[Pasted image 20240221152031.png|400]]
- The rod is able to move horizontally which is perpendicularly
- Because there is only one loop, 
	- $\varepsilon = \dfrac {\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = \dfrac {\Delta (BA)}{\Delta t} = B \dfrac {\Delta A}{\Delta t}$
	- for a uniform magnetic field
- The rate of change of area $\dfrac {\Delta A}{\Delta t} = \dfrac {Lv\Delta t}{\Delta t} = vL$
- Therefore:
	- $\varepsilon = BvL$
### Induction because of motion of a coil into and out of a uniform magnetic field
![[Pasted image 20240221154823.png| 350]]
- In this example:
$\varepsilon = N\dfrac {\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t} = NA \cdot \dfrac {\Delta B}{\Delta t}$
### Induction between materials 
- **mutual induction** - Electromagnetic induction between separate circuits

![[Pasted image 20240221155247.png|400]]
- The changing magnetic flux passing through coil $B$ depends on the rate at which the current, $I$ is changing in coil A
- For mutual induction in a fixed arrangement $\dfrac {\Delta \Phi}{\Delta t}$ and the induced emf, $\varepsilon$, are proportional to $\dfrac {\Delta I}{\Delta t}$
## Energy transfers during electromagnetic induction
- **Eddy currents** - Circulating currents induced in solid pieces of metal when changing magnetic fields pass through them
- An induced electric current has had energy transferred to it from the process that induced it, for example from the kinetic energy of motion
- Whenever the magnetic is moved in any way, a current will be induced and the magnetic field of that current will tend to stop the movement. This application of the law conservation of energy is known as **Len's law** and it is the reason for the negative sign in Faraday's law
### Lenz's law 
- **Lenz's law (of electromagnetic induction)** - The direction of an induced emf is such that it will oppose the change that produced it. 
## Electromagnetic induction in rotating coils

## Alternating current (ac) generators
![[Pasted image 20240221161952.png| 400]]

- If the coil is rotating, there will be a changing magnetic flux passing through it and a chainging emf will be induced. 
- As WX moves upwards, the induced emf will make a current flow. 
- The emfs induced is opposite sides of a coil rotating in a magnetic field act in series to drive a current around teh coil. 
- The connection between the coil and the external circuit cannot be fixed and permanent because the wires would become twisted as the coil is rotated. Therefore, brushes are used with slip rings.
- **Slip rigs and brushes** - In an ac generator these are used for connecting the rotating coil to the external circuit. 
- **Turbine** - Device that transfers the energy from a moving fluid to do mechanical work and cause rotation. 
- **Alternator** - ac electrical generator

# Self-induction
- When a current in any circuit changes, the magnetic flux associated with that current also change. 
- therefore, induction also occurs within the same circuit and then the induced emf opposes the change of current, so that it cats in the reverse direction to the original emf producing the current
- **back-emf** - An induced potential difference that opposes a change of current in the same circuit. 
- The magnitude of self-induction effects will change with the magnetic properties of different surrounding materials. This
