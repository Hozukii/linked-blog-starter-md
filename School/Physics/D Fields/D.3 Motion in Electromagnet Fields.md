# The motion of charged particles in uniform electric fields
## Stationary charged particles
- A particle with charge $q$ situated in an electric field will experience a force $F = Fq$ towards the oppositely charged plate. 
- "Stationary" mobile charges will accelerate along a field line in a uniform electric field.

## Charged particles moving across a uniform electric field
- Freely moving charged particles travelling across electric fields will move in parabolic paths

# The motion of charged particles in uniform magnetic fields
- A "stationary" charge in a magnetic field will not experience any magnetic force
- Any charge *moving* in a magnetic field will experience a magnetic force unless its motion is parallel to the magnetic field.

- In this image:
	- If the charge was positive, the  force on the particle acts perpendicularly downwards, into the paper. 
	- If the particle was negatively charged, the the force on the particle acts perpendicularly upwards, out of the paper.
- Because of the magnetic force, the charged particle will not continue to move in a straight line. 
- Because the force is perpendicular to the velocity, this is the necessary condition for circular motion.
