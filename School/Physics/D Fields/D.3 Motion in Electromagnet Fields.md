# The motion of charged particles in uniform electric fields
## Stationary charged particles
- A particle with charge $q$ situated in an electric field will experience a force $F = Fq$ towards the oppositely charged plate. 
- "Stationary" mobile charges will accelerate along a field line in a uniform electric field.

## Charged particles moving across a uniform electric field
- Freely moving charged particles travelling across electric fields will move in parabolic paths

# The motion of charged particles in uniform magnetic fields
- A "stationary" charge in a magnetic field will not experience any magnetic force
- Any charge *moving* in a magnetic field will experience a magnetic force unless its motion is parallel to the magnetic field.

- In this image:
	- If the charge was positive, the  force on the particle acts perpendicularly downwards, into the paper. 
	- If the particle was negatively charged, the the force on the particle acts perpendicularly upwards, out of the paper.
- Because of the magnetic force, the charged particle will not continue to move in a straight line. 
- Because the force is perpendicular to the velocity, this is the necessary condition for circular motion.

- During its circular motion in a perpendicular magnetic field, the speed and the kinetic energy of the charged particle will remain constant.
## Equation for the force on a charged particle moving across a magnetic field
#### Lorentz law
- Describes the force on a charged particle moving in a magnetic field. 
$$F = qvBsin\theta$$
F - force in $N$
$q$ - charge in coulombs
$v$ is velocity in $ms^{-1}$
B - magnetic field strength in Teslas(T)
$\theta$ angle between the velocity vector of the charged particle and the magnetic field.
- if a particle charge ($q$) moves with a velocity ($v$) in the presence of an electric field ($E$) and a magnetic field ($B$), then it will experience a force 
- This is simply because a moving charge creates a magnetic field
- Therefore, magnetic field inside another magnetic field will feel a force
---
- If a particle smoving perpendicularly its $sin(90) = 1$ so it can be reduced to $F = qvB$
- This magnetic force can be considered as the *centripetal force* causing circular motion
- We know that from:
	- [[A.2 Forces and Momentum#Circular Motion and Centripetal forces]]
	- $F = \dfrac {mv^2}r$
- So that $qvB = \dfrac{mv^2}r$, which can be rearranged to shaow that:
- $r = \dfrac{mv}{qB}$
- For any given situation, if only one of these fields is non-zero, the formula simplifies. If ($E$) is non-zero and ($B$) is zero, the formula becomes ($E = qE$) and we have the simple eelectrostatic force. If ($E$) is zero and ($B$) is non-zero, the formula becomes ($F = qvBsin\theta$) , which is the formula for the magnetic force. This is why the Lorentz force is given by ... 
$$F = qE + qvBsin\theta$$
#### BIL Law (alternate Lorentz law)
$$F = BILsin\theta$$
F - magnetic force acting on the conductor, measured in N
B - magnetic flux density of the field, measured in Tesla
I - Current flowing through the conductor, measured in meters
$\theta$ - angle between the conductor and the magnetic field lines, measured in degrees. 
- fundamental equation in electromagnetism 
- Is the force equation on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field with magnetic flux density
- The maximum force occurs when the conductor is perpendicular to the field
