This is for the IB TOK essay. The TOK is a maximum 1600 word essay which must discuss one of the prescribed titles. The title that has been chosen is:
6. Does acquiring knowledge destroy our sense of wonder? Discuss with reference to two areas of knowledge.

The two areas of knowledge that I have chosen in natural sciences and the arts. 
For natural sciences, I want to use the example of max planck's publication, "On the Theory of the Energy Distribution Law of the Normal Spectrum". Which came right after the quote said by Lord Kelvin "there is nothing new to be discovered in physics now. all that remains is more and more precise measurement."

For the Arts, i want to take the example of heri matisses painting and how given the context of his personal life, it affects our sense of wonder. 

Give me a structure for the essay in the form of Introduction, Example 1, Example 2, Counterargument, Evaluation, Conclusion + implications.

Further details of the structure is written in the attatched pdf document:
