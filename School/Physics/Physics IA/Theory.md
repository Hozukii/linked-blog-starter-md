### Calculating the velocity / momentum of the ball before impact
$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$
$$v = \sqrt {2\cdot 9.81 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.39}$$
$$ v = 3.9 ms^{-1}$$
- There are three period to calculate. 
	- The $t_1$ to $t_2$ where the tablecloth interacts with the cart
	- $t_2$ to $t_3$ where the cart is airborne
	- $t_3$ to $t_4$ where the cart interacts with the ground 

#### $t_2$ to $t_3$

- Velocity of the cart $v_c$
- By finding the time it takes to touch the ground, we can calculate the horzontal displacement
- time to touch the ground 
$$ s_t = \dfrac 12at^2$$

$$ t = \sqrt {4.9\cdot s_t}$$
where $s_t$ - tablecloth thickness
displacement by the cart is
$$s = v_c \cdot t$$
$$ s = v_c \cdot \sqrt{4.9 \cdot s_t}$$
