# Oscillations 
- **Oscillation** - Repetitive motion about a fixed point. 
- **Simple Harmonic motion** - An idealized oscillation that maintains a constant amplitude and frequency. 
- In a perfect SHM, the oscillations always take the same time (isochronous) and there are no resistive forces, so that they continue oscillating indefinitely with no loss of energy and constant amplitude. 
- **Isochronous** - Describing events that take equal time. 
## Terms used to describe oscillations and SHM
- **Equilibrium position** - Position in which there is no resultant force acting on an object.

- If a mass is then displaced, oscillation may occur if there is always a resultant *restoring force* pulling, and /or pushing it back toward equilibrium position. 
- The mass will gain kinetic energy as it moves back where it came from. 
- Because of inertia , it will the n pass through the equilibrium. 
- Kinetic energy is transferred to some form of potential energy in the system, and when the kinetic energy has reduced to zero, the mass will stop and then reverse its motion. 
- The *displacement*, $x$, of an oscillator is its distance from the equilibrium position in a certain direction. 
- The **amplitude**, $x_0$ - maximum displacement of an oscillation (or wave)
- One *oscillation* is completed every time that an oscillating mass returns to a certain position, moving in the same direction often called a **cycle**
- **Time period**, $T$ - Time taken for one complete oscillation. 
- **Frequency**, $f$ - The number of oscillations per unit time:
	- $1Hz$  = $\dfrac {\text{1 oscillation}}{1sec}$
	- $T = \dfrac 1f$
- The time period and frequency of most practical oscillations remain isochronous, even when the amplitude reduces because of energy dissipation. 
## Connection between SHM and circular motion
- Circular motion discussed in:
	- [[A.2 Forces and Momentum#Circular Motion and Centripetal forces]]
- Motion in a circle has exactly the same pattern of movement as a simple oscillation. 
![[Pasted image 20240305195121.png|400]]

- As the particle moves, the point P oscillates along the diameter with the same frequency as the particle's circular motion, and with an amplitude equal to the radius, $r$ , of the circule. 
- The concept of angular velocity, $\omega$, was introduced in A.2.
	- In the study of SHM, $\omega$ is angular frequency. 
- **Angular frequency**, $\omega$ - Used to represent the frequency of an oscillation in $rads^{-1}$. 
- $\omega = \dfrac {rad}{sec}$
#### $$\omega = \dfrac {2\pi}T = 2\pi f$$
## Two commonly investigated oscillators
##### why mass-spring system and a simple pendulum are important
Includes:
- The proportional relationship between force and displacement are easily understood
- Their periods of oscillation have a convenient time for measurement in a school lab
- They are good approximations to simple harmonic motion
- Energy is dissipated slowly
- They act as starting points for understanding many similar, but more complex, oscillators
## Mass-spring system
![[Pasted image 20240305195839.png|570]]

- The relationship for the SHM of a mass on a spring:
	- Time period of a mass-spring system:
#### $$T = 2\pi \sqrt {\dfrac mk}$$
- $m$ - mass
- $k$ - spring constant ($N/m$)
- The period of a spring-mass system is proportional to the square root of the mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the spring constant.
- Since $\omega = \dfrac {2\pi}T$,  this equation can also be written as: $\omega ^2 = \dfrac km$
## Simple Pendulum 
- **Pendulum** - A weight, which is suspended below a pivot, which is able to swing from side to side. 
	- Weight is sometimes called the **pendulum bob**
	- **Simple pendulum** - point mass on the end of an inextensible string

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |


- the weight, $mg$, of the pendulum is conveniently resolved into two components: 
	- A force $mg \space sin \theta$ provides the restoring force
	- $mg \space cos \theta$ keep s the rod/string in tension. 
- For small amplitudes, the time period, $T$, depends only its length,$l$ (measured from its point of support to its centre of mass)
- mass will not affect is because doubling the mass, for example, will also result in doubling the restoring force. 



- Relationship for the SHM of a simple pendulum:
- time period of a simple pendulum:
#### $$T = 2\pi \sqrt {\dfrac lg}$$
- $l$ - length
- $g$ - gravity
## Conditions that Produce Simple Harmonic Motion
- **Simple Harmonic Motion** will occur if the restoring force, $F$, is proportional to the displacement, $x$, but the force always acts back towards the equilibrium position (Hooke's Law)
$$F \propto -x$$
For a simple pendulum, the restoring force, $mg\space sin \theta$  is (almost) proportional to the displacement angle, $\theta$ if the angle is small 
- **Simple harmonic motion** - Oscillations in which the acceleration, $a$, is proportional to the displacement, $x$, and in the opposite direction, directed back at the equilibrium position.
$$a \propto -x$$
- Therefore, amplitude does not affect time period
	- Since if displacement(amplitude doubles) so will the acceleration
- The constant must involve frequency because the magnitude of the acceleration is greater if the frequency is higher. 
#### $$ a = -\omega^2 x$$
### Graphs of SHM

- The waveform seen is commonly described as being **sinusoidal** in shape
- We can use the graph to calculate the velocity of the oscillating mass at any particular moment by determining the gradient of the displacement
- Velocity,$v = \dfrac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}$
- Similarly, acceleration, $a = \dfrac {\Delta v}{\Delta t}$
- The velocity has its maximum value, $v_0$, when the displacement, $x$ is 0
- Velocity is 0 when the displacement is at maximum $\pm x_0$
- The acceleration has its maximum when the velocity is 0 and displacement is greatest
- SHM graphs of displacement, velocity, and accelerations are all sinusoidal in shape, but their maximum values occur at different times.
