# Introduction
- International transaction of a country are recorded in their **balance of payments**
- **Balance of payments** consists of 
	- The current account
	- The capital account
	- The financial account
# Balance of Payments (BOP)
- Balance of payments is "balanced" when the sum of the 3 is zero
$$ \text{Current Account + Financial account + capital Account + net errors and omissions = 0}$$
 - Discounting net errors and omissions, it can be written as:
 $$ \text {Current Account = - (Financial Account + Capital account)}$$
## Debits and Credits
- In national income accounting, money items are sorted into
	- **debits (Dr)** - Outflows of money
	- **credits (Cr)** -Inflows of money
- A debit value in the current account is matched with an identical credit value in the financial account and/or capital account
- similarly, a credit value is matched with an identical debit value.
- As a result, deficit in the current account is matched with a surplus in the financial account and/or capital account
- similarly, a surplus is matched with a deficit. 
# components of the balance of payments

$$ \text {Net income from abroad = Income from abroad - Income paid abroad}$$
### Current transfers
- **Current transfers** - inflows and outflows of money that are not made in exchange for trade or any corresponding output
