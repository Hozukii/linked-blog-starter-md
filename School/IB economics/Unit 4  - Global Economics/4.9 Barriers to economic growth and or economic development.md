- **Barriers to economic growth and development** - factors that may restrict income growth or other factors of economic development. it can be divided into
	- technological
	- geographical
	- political
	- social 
# Poverty cycle 
- **poverty cycle**, **poverty trap** - series of processes which result in continuous poverty over time
![[poverty cycle.png|300]]
1. Low income consumers for consumers means most income is spent on necessities, resulting in little savings
2. Low savings leads to limited funds for investments to support natural, physical, and human capital
3. Low levels of investment hinders productive capacity 
4. Low productivity results in low levels of income growth as income in dependent on output
5. Low income growth ultimately means households are stuck with low income and cycle continues. 
# Economic Barriers
### Rising economic inequality
- **Economic inequality** - measured by the Gini coefficient or the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. 
- Governments with low-income countries can implement progressive tax 
	- However, it is often difficult to raise tax revenues due to different reasons
		- Only a small percentage earn sufficient income
		- Revenues collected from corporate taxes tend to be low due to low economic activity
		- Tariff revenues tend to be lo due to low levels of international trade.

- Economic inequality real world example:
	-[[The Rich, Poor , and trash]]
## Lack of access to infrastructure 
- **Infrastructure** - large public facilities that adds to the capital stock of a country and is necessary for economic activity
	- this includes transportation networks, schools, hospitals, telecommunication networks etc.
- lack of infrastructure in low income countries hinders efficiency and productivity 
	- Example:country with poor transportation networks makes it harder to engage in domestic and international trade. 
- it limits the country's industrial production, discouraging international companies to invest in the country 
## Low Levels of human capital
- Investment in education and healthcare increases the quantity and quality of labor, hence raising the economy's productive capacity
## Dependence on primary sector production
- They include: agricultural farming, fishing, mineral extraction etc.
- Since crop yields can be unstable due to external factors such as the weather, national income can be very volatile if the country is overdependent on the primary sector. 

## Lack of access to international markets
- MEDCs often impose protectionist measures and form trading blocs, making ELDCs unable to compete. 
- This leads to loss of trade as the are unable to specialize in the export of certain goods.
## Informal economy
- **Informal economy** - Economic activity that is not recorded in a country's GDP. 
	- Includes:
		- self-employment
		- Subsistence farming 
		- Workers paid in cash
		- etc...
- Since these are not monitored, they are not liable for tax
- Makes economic activities difficult to tax and regulate. 
- While these individuals enjoy government services, they don't pay income taxes in return 
- 
## Capital flight
- **Capital flight** - when firms take their money and resources out of the country due to economic and political uncertainties. 
	- cause and consequence of falling business confidence, which hinders economic growth and development.
- Reasons for the interconnectedness between capital flight and the low business confidence:
	- Political instability
	- Social unrest leading to higher crime rates
	- Fluctuations in exchange rates
	- Concerns over the banking system due to a weak credit rating
	- Expectations of the nationalization of privately owned assets
	- Anticipation of higher taxes
	- Environmental degradation
## Indebtedness
- **Indebtedness** - refers to the of owing money by individuals, households or governments.
- Countries that accumulate high levels of debts may not be able to fund investment projects for economic development.
- ELDCs tend to have higher debt-to-GDP ratio. 
## Geography including landlocked countries
- Geography can influence the economic development of a country 
- Cities with trading ports have access to shipping routes and thus experience faster factor mobilization and higher volumes of trade. 
	- landlocked economies have limited trading routes so may experience lower volumes of trade. 
- Countries in arid areas struggle in subsistence farming due to their climate
## Tropical climates and endemic diseases 
- Countries with hot climates are prone to endemic diseases 
- They lowers labor productivity, while the population growth increases to make up for the high death rate 
# Political and Social Barriers
![[Pasted image 20241111132606.png|500]]
## Weak Institutional framework
- **Institutional framework** - Established systems and structures that shape economic behavior in an economy or society. 
- This includes political, legal, financial, and social systems
- Weak institutional framework discourages domestic and inward foreign investments. 
- Strong institutional framework provides a stable economic environment for FDI. 
- The legal system is concerned with the law and regulations of the country. 
#### Taxation Structures
- Large informal sector and poor institutional frameworks in ELDCs encourages tax avoidance and corruption, which ultimately restrict economic growth and development
#### Banking system
