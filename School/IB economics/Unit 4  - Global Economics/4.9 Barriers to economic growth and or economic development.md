- **Barriers to economic growth and development** - factors that may restrict income growth or other factors of economic development. it can be divided into
	- technological
	- geographical
	- political
	- social 
# Poverty cycle 
- **poverty cycle**, **poverty trap** - series of processes which result in continuous poverty over time
![[poverty cycle.png|300]]
1. Low income consumers for consumers means most income is spent on necessities, resulting in little savings
2. Low savings leads to limited funds for investments to support natural, physical, and human capital
3. Low levels of investment hinders productive capacity 
4. Low productivity results in low levels of income growth as income in dependent on output
5. Low income growth ultimately means households are stuck with low income and cycle continues. 
# Economic Barriers
### Rising economic inequality
- **Economic inequality** - measured by the Gini coefficient or the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index. 
- Governments with low-income countries can implement progressive tax 
	- However, it is often difficult to raise tax revenues due to different reasons
		- Only a small percentage earn sufficient income
		- Revenues collected from corporate taxes tend to be low due to low economic activity
		- Tariff revenues tend to be lo due to low levels of international trade.

- Economic inequality real world example:
	-[[The Rich, Poor , and trash]]
## Lack of access to infrastructure 
- **Infrastructure** - large public facilities that adds to the capital stock of a country and is necessary for economic activity
	- this includes transportation networks, schools, hospitals, telecommunication networks etc.
- lack of infrastructure in low income countries hinders efficiency and productivity 
	- Example: country with poor transportation networks makes it harder to engage in domestic and international trade. 
- it limits the country's industrial production, discouraging international companies to invest in the country 
## Low Levels of human capital
- Investment in education and healthcare increases the quantity and quality of labour, hence raising the economy's productive capacity
## Dependence on primary sector production
- They include: agricultural farming, fishing, mineral extraction etc.
- Since crop yields can be unstable due to external factors such as the weather, national income can be very volatile if the country is overdependent on the primary sector. 

## Lack of access to international markets
- MEDCs often impose protectionist measures and form trading blocs, making ELDCs unable to compete. 
- This leads to loss of trade as the are unable to specialize in the export of certain goods.
## Informal economy
- **Informal economy** - Economic activity that is not recorded in a country's GDP. 
	- Includes:
		- self-employment
		- Subsistence farming 
		- Workers paid in cash
		- etc...
- Since these are not monitored, they are not liable for tax
- Makes economic activities difficult to tax and regulate. 
- While these individuals enjoy government services, they don't pay income taxes in return 
- 
## Capital flight
- **Capital flight** - when firms take their money and resources out of the country due to economic and political uncertainties. 
	- cause and consequence of falling business confidence, which hinders economic growth and development.
- Reasons for the interconnectedness between capital flight and the low business confidence:
	- Political instability
	- Social unrest leading to higher crime rates
	- Fluctuations in exchange rates
	- Concerns over the banking system due to a weak credit rating
	- Expectations of the nationalization of privately owned assets
	- Anticipation of higher taxes
	- Environmental degradation
## Indebtedness
- **Indebtedness** - refers to the of owing money by individuals, households or governments.
- Countries that accumulate high levels of debts may not be able to fund investment projects for economic development.
- ELDCs tend to have higher debt-to-GDP ratio. 
## Geography including landlocked countries
- Geography can influence the economic development of a country 
- Cities with trading ports have access to shipping routes and thus experience faster factor mobilization and higher volumes of trade. 
	- landlocked economies have limited trading routes so may experience lower volumes of trade. 
- Countries in arid areas struggle in subsistence farming due to their climate
## Tropical climates and endemic diseases 
- Countries with hot climates are prone to endemic diseases 
- They lowers labor productivity, while the population growth increases to make up for the high death rate 
# Political and Social Barriers
![[Pasted image 20241111132606.png|500]]
## Weak Institutional framework
- **Institutional framework** - Established systems and structures that shape economic behavior in an economy or society. 
- This includes political, legal, financial, and social systems
- Weak institutional framework discourages domestic and inward foreign investments. 
- Strong institutional framework provides a stable economic environment for FDI. 
- The legal system is concerned with the law and regulations of the country. 
#### Taxation Structures
- Large informal sector and poor institutional frameworks in ELDCs encourages tax avoidance and corruption, which ultimately restrict economic growth and development
#### Banking system
- **Banking system** - offers credit to individuals and firms for consumption and investment. 
- Many ELDCs lack the credit necessary for investments in human or physical capital, hindering economic development. 
- Increasing number of economies have adopted **microcredit** schemes to individuals and small businesses
#### Property rights
- **Property rights** - entitlement of assets owned by an individual, organization or country. 
- Property rights allow the owner:
	- Exclusive use of the good
	- Exclusive rights to earn income from the asset
	- Enforce property rights
	- Transfer ownership of the asset to others
- Lack of protection and enforcement for property rights discourages domestic and inward foreign direct investments
- If governments of ELDCs can't safeguard assets, the lack of property rights will lead to over-consumption, under-investment and exploitation of natural resources. 
## Gender inequality
- In some countries, women are not allowed to work, drive or vote, lowering the labour productivity and national output. 
- One of UN sustainable goals.
- The solutions from World Development Report:
	- Improve healthcare and education provision to women
	- Increase employment opportunities for women to participate in the labour force.
	- Increase females' voice and agency in society 
	- Limit the reoccurrence of gender inequality across generations
## Lack of good governance/ corruption
- Transactions that involve corruption and bribery are not officially recorded as part of national income. 
- Corruption leads to misallocation of resources and makes the country unattractive for investors. 
- Corruption perception Index (CPI) (not consumer price index) ranks the level of public sector corruption in different countries. 
- Corruption tends to be more severe in developing economies
- In the long run, corruption decreases tax revenues and encourages the emergence of informal sectors
## Unequal political power and status
- In many socies, political power is held by a small group of people. Inequality in the political system prevents economic progress benefiting the entire society, hindering economic development. 
# Significance of different barriers to economic growth 
- For ELDCs, there are five main domestic factors contributing to their economic development:
	- Education & Health
	- Use of technology
	- Access to credit
	- Empowerment of women
	- Income distribution
- There can be different levels of economic growth and development due to:
	- Resource endowment 
	- Historical conflict
	- Political systems
	- Political stability
	- Climate 
	- Population
