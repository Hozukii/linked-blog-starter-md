- **International trade** - the exchange of goods, services, and resources between nations. 
## Benefits of international trade
- Increased population

- Access to larger markets
- Economics of scale
- More efficient resource allocation
- More efficient production
## Modeling international trade 

#### closed economy
- without international trade, the market consist of domestic consumers ($D_d$ ) and domestic producers ($S_d$) and market equilibrium at $P_e$ and $Q_e$
#### open economy

- With international trade, the US oil market is open to international producers.
- assumes Perfectly elastic, which means there is sufficient global supply to satisfy any level of demand the world market price ($)
- Assumes that the product is homogeneous without differentiation
	- assumed to be perfect substitutes
- Price of US oil may be higher or lower than international competitors
	- depends on relative efficiency of producers
#### Open economy where $P_w > P_e$ 
![[US_Oil_market_export.png|400]]
- If $P_w > P_e$ , domestic Us oil producers would be able to sell their oil at $P_w$ instead of $P_e$
- $P_w$ would become the new market equilibrium
![[US_oil_market_surplus_exports.png|400]]
- Market price raises $P_e \to P_w$ 
- Quantity demanded decreases from $Q_e \to Q_d$ 
- Quantity supplied increases from $Q_e \to Q_s$
- At $P_w$, domestic consumers purchase $Q_d$ quantity
- Consumer surplus decreases
- Producer surplus increases
#### Open economy where $P_w < P_e$

![[US oil market imports.png|400]]
- If $P_w < P_e$, domestic Us consumers would be able to purchase oil at $P_w$ instead of $P_e$ 
- $P_w$ would become the new market equilibrium price in the domestic US oil market
![[US oil market surplus imports.png|400]]
- Market price falls from $P_e \to P_w$ 
- Quantity demanded increases from $Q_e \to Q_d$ 
- quantity supplied decreases from $Q_e \to Q_s$
- At $P_w$, domestic producers produce $Q_s$ 
- $Q_d -Q_s$ is imported from international producers
---
- Consumers surplus increases with trade
- Producer surplus decreases with trade
