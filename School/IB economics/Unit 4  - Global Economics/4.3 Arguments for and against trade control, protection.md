# Free trade vs trade protection
##### Free trade 
- Better allocation of resources
- economies of scale
- lower prices
- more choice
- domestic firms have incentive to become more efficient
- increased export competitiveness 
##### trade protection
- protection of infant industries
- national security
- health and safety and environmental standards
- anti-dumping and unfair competition
- balance of payments correction
- government revenue
- protection of jobs 
- Economically least develop country diversification
# Arguments for trade protection 
## Protection of infant (sunrise) industries
- **infant industry** one which is in its early stages of development and requires government protection before being able to compete with foreign competitors
- Unlike established firms, infant industries do not benefit from economies of scale. 
## National security
- Some industries must be protected by the government as certain goods are essential for national defence 
- thus should be produced domestically in case of wars or other national emergencies
## Environmental standards
## Dumping
- **Dumping** - the practice of firms selling products in foreign markets at below cost prices or prices set below their own domestic market
## Anti-dumping 
- Dumping often occurs when firms experience excess supply or excess subsidies resulting in the selling of goods at very low prices abroad 
- To combat it, government often have *anti-dumping measures* to prevent domestic firms from closing down or workers losing their jobs.
## Balance of payments correction 
- **The balance of payments** - record of all transactions made between the domestic country and the rest of the world over a particular time period
- A deficit in the balance of payments occurs when debits exceed credits
	- **Debits** - outflow of money from a country
	- **Credits** - inflow of money into a country
- Governments can reduce a deficit in the balance of payments by imposing trade protectionist policies
## Government revenue
- One revenue source for government is imposing tariffs
##### PED and government revenue
- If the government's objective is to raise revenue, they may impose higher taxes on goods and services with inelastic demand

## Protection of jobs 
- Low unemployment is a key macroeconomic objective
- Trade protection helps safeguards domestic jobs by shifting consumer expenditure to increase domestic production and consumption
- The trade off is lower efficiency and a global misallocation of resources
- In the long run, it may be more suitable for governments to use supply side policies to increase the competitiveness of firms
## Economically least developed countries (ELDC)
- **Economically least developed country** - low-income country which faces severe structural barriers to sustainable development 
- Typical characteristic of ELDCs are high concentration of economic activity in the primary sector. 
- Primary commodity prices are volitile and usually inelastic.
- Hence, ELDCs may use trade protectionists measures to diversify production into secondary and tertiary activities
# Arguments against trade protection
- Trade protection leads to misallocation of resources 
- Unable to achieve allocative efficiency as more goods and services are produced by the less efficient producers
- Lack of incentives for domestic producers to become more efficient 
## Retaliation 
- An argument against using trade protection is that same countries may retaliate by imposing trade barriers in response
## Increased costs
- Raises the cost of production for domestic producers who imports raw materials 
## Higher prices
- Tariffs lead to higher prices for consumers who import goods and services. 
- Quotas lead to a shortage in the market which also leads to higher prices for consumers.

## Less choice
- Limits the variety of goods and services available to domestic consumers which corresponds to lower standards of living 
## Reduced export competitiveness 
- When domestic producers are protected against foreign competition, there is less incentive to lower costs and to innovate
