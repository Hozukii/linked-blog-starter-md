- **Economic development** - improvement in the standards of living and and the quality of life for an economy as a whole
## Introduction
- There are two types of indicators which can be used to measure development. 
- They include:
	- Single indicators
	- Composite indicators
## Strengths and limitations of measuring economic development
- any single measurement will have its shortcomings:
	- Some indicators may measure a strength of a country, over estimating economic development as a whole
	- Economic development is qualitative and both single and composite indicators may fail to quantify it
	- Development indicators can't measure political or sociocultural
	- Data errors and omissions will skew the value of indicators, especially in countries with poor data access. 
- As There are numerous indicators which measure development that interrelate and complement one another, whether they are single or composite
# Single Indicators
- **Single Indicators** - measures one specific characteristic of Development. 
They Include:
- GDP / GNI per capita PPP
- Health and education indicators 
- Economic / social inequality indicators
- Energy indicators 
## GDP / GNI per capita at PPP
- **Purchasing power** - The amonut of goods and services that can be bought with one unit of a currency
- **Purchasing power parity (PPP)** - The exchange rate needed to buy the same basket of goods and services in different countries using the same amount of money.
- **GDP/GNI per capita at PPP** - Measures the average income of an economy adjusted for PPP and si most common to measure the standards of living in a nation 
- GNI per capita is a better indicators of standards of living as it represents the average income received by its citizens 
- While economic growth is a necessary components of development, it does not always lead to economic development. 
Growth may be accompanied with:
- Negative externalities of consumption & production 
- Degradation of natural resources and common access resources
- Structural unemployment due to sectorial changes
## Health and education indicators 
- Measures health-elated determinants which impacts one's quality of life, such as:
	- **Life expectancy at birth** - average number of years one is expected to live.
		- **Quality-adjusted life years** - estimate the average number of years one is in "perfect health"
	- Health care expenditure (as percentage of GDP)
	- Infant mortality rates - number of infant death from the time to birth until age 1 as a ratio. 
- Education can improve a country's human capital and help break the poverty cycle
- Education indicators measured determinants such as:
	- **Mean years of schooling** - average years of formal education received by aged 25 and older in their lifetime
	- **Expected years of schooling** - years of formal education that one can expect to receive in their lifetime
		- Can be used as predicator for the mean years of schooling
	- **Adult literacy rate** - measure of percentage of population who are:
		- greater than 15 years of age 
		- Able to read and write a short statement with basic understanding in one or more languages
## Economic / Social inequality indicators
- **Economic / social inequality indicators**  - measure the differences in access to resources, services and institutions by demographic groups. 
- This includes:
	- Gini coefficient
		- [[3.4 Economics of Inequality and poverty#Gini coefficient]]
	- **Gender pay gap** - measures the percentage difference in income across genders. 
		- Takes into account differences in experience, occupation, education, the terms of employment, family care burdens, and other factors. 
## Energy indicators
- **Energy indicators** - measure economic development using indicators that identify factors needed to create affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for citizens. 
- They include:
	- **Access to electricity** - Measures the percentage of the population with access to functioning electricity
	- **Energy consumption per capita** - Average energy consumption of a person (often kilowatt-hours)
	- **Energy consumption by source** - Compares proportion of total energy generated by each source (oil, natural gas, renewable, nuclear, etc.). 
		- Often visualized as a [[Sankey Diagram]]
	- **Share of electricity production from renewables** - Measures the percentage of electricity production generated by renewables. 
## Environmental Indicators
- **Environmental indicators** - measure environmental or ecological issues that influence the standard of living and quality of life. 
- This includes:
	- **CO2 emissions per capita** 
	- **Ecological footprint** - Measure of demand of economic activity on natural resources. 
# Composite Indicators
- **Composite indicators** - Measure and combine multiple characteristics of development and are usually presented as an index number.
- They include the:
	- Human Development Index (HDI)
	- Inequality adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
	- Gender Inequality Index (GII)
	- Happy Planet Index (HPI)
## Human Development Index (HDI)
- **Human Development Index (HDI)** - Index of healthcare, educational attainment and income.
- Used as alternative to real GDP or GNI per capita as a measure of economic development. 
- The indicators are:
	- Life expectancy at birth
	- Mean years of schooling
	- GNI per capita at PPP
## Inequality adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI)
- **IHDI** - accounts for inequalities in the distribution of healthcare, education, and income in an economy
$$\text {IHDI} = \text{percentage loss due to inequalities} \cdot \text{HDI}$$
## Gender Inequality Index (GII)
- **Gender Inequality Index** - calculates gender disparities between sexes from reproductive health, empowerment, and labour market participation as a measure of development.
- This includes:
	- **Maternal mortality ratio** - death of mothers per 100,000 live births
	- **Adolescent fertility rate** - Number of births from mothers between the ages of 15 and 19 per 1000 live births 
	- Share of parliamentary seats held by each sex
	- Attainment at secondary and higher education 
	- **Labour market participation rate** - percentage of citizens between 15 and 64 years of age who are in the labour force
## Happy Planet Index (HPI)
- **Happy Planet Index** - measures how individuals and countries are able to achieve long, happy and sustainable lives in terms of wellbeing, health, inequality, and the environment. 
- This includes:
	- Subjective wellbeing (1 to 10)
	- Life expectancy at birth
	- Ecological footprint
	- **Inequality-adjusted life expectancy** - Mean life expectancy of resident of a country, adjusted to reflect inequalities in the distribution of lifetimes
	- **Inequality-adjusted experienced wellbeing** - Average experienced wellbeing of residents of a country, adjusted to reflect inequalities in the distribution of experienced wellbeing.
