# Introduction
- **Exchange rate** - The value of a certain currency in terms of another currency
# Foreign exchange market
- A foreign exchange market can be modeled using a demand and supply diagram

# Exchange rate systems
- There are three types of exchange rates systems
	- Floating 
	- Fixed
	- Managed
## Floating Exchange Rates
- **Floating exchange rate** - Value of a currency is determined by market forces of demand and supply without government intervention
- **Appreciation** - The rise in the value of a currency in a floating exchange system
![[Appreciation of Euros.png|600]]
- **Deprecation** - fall in the value of a currency in a floating exchange rate system
![[Deprecation of Euros.png|600]]
### Appreciation
- When the value of the euro increases , it is known to appreciate
#### Why might the demand curve increase? 
![[Pasted image 20240930133127.png|400]]
- Increased demand for EU exports
	- Firms in the Eurozone expect to be paid in Euros
- Increased investment towards the Eurozone 
	- Foreign firms fund FDI by purchasing the Euro
	- Foreign investors fund portfolio investment by purchasing the Euro
- Remittances from expatriates
	- Expats may remit their foreign income back to the Eurozone
	- For remittances to be spent within the Eurozone, foreign currencies must be converted to Euro
- Speculation
	- speculators might buy expecting its value to rise
	- leads to self-fulfilling prophecy, as it increases demand for the Euro, leading it to appreciate, ceteris paribus
- A fall in relative inflation rates
	- When inflation rate is lower than global average, its exports will be relatively cheaper than the rest of the world
	- Increased demand for the exports appreciates the Euro 
#### Why might the supply curve decrease? 
![[Increase in supply for Euros.png|400]]
- Fall in domestic demand for imports 
	- When residents of the eurozone import less good and services, they exchange less of their Euro for foreign currencies leading the supply curve to decrease
- A fall in outward investment from Eurozone
	- It will decrease the amount of selling of Euros reducing the supply of the Euro
- Central bank intervention
	- Central banks may restrict the supply 
	- Some currencies can only be legally traded from approved outlets
	- This prevents governments or large groups of investors from manipulating given currency
### Depreciation
- When the value of the Euro falls, it is known to depreciate
#### Why might the demand curve fall? 
![[Pasted image 20240930134825.png|400]]
- fall in demand for exports from Eurozone
- A fall in inward direct and portfolio investment
- A fall in remittances 
- Speculation that the exchange rate will fall
- A rise in relative inflation rates
- A fall in relative interest and growth rates
#### Why might the supply curve rise? 
- An increase in domestic demand for imports
- An increase in outward investment from the Eurozone
- A fall in central bank intervation 
## Consequences of Changes in Floating Exchange Rates
- **E** - Economic Growth
- **L** - Living standards
- **I** - Inflation
- **T** - Trade balance {net exports)
- **E** - Employment
### Consequences of Deprecation
- Deprecation in the exchange rate will:
	- Cheaper exports
	- More expensive imports
	- Overall, improves a country's trade balance and consequently AD. Increasing economic growth
	- A rise in AD may lead to **demand pull inflation**
	![[demand pull inflation exchange rates.png|400]]
	- Imported factors of production will be more expensive reducing producers' willingness to produce
	- This leads to **cost-push inflation** as supply shift inwards
![[cost push inflation due to currency.png|400]]
### Consequences of Appreciation
- An appreciation in the exchange rate will:
	- More expensive imports for foreign consumers
	- Cheaper imports
	- Overall, worsens a country's trade balance, decreasing economic growth and hence standards of living
	- Due to lower AD, producers will produce at a lower level of output
	- As the economy is below full capacity, this leads to unemployment
# Fix Exchange Rates
- **Fixed exchange rate system** - central bank and/or government of an economy fixes the value of the national currency to the value of another currency at a particular level

- Central bank and/or the government must actively intervene in the foreign exchange market in order to influence demand and supply of the currency to maintain the exchange rate at the predetermined level. 

- Intervention may take several forms:
	- Buying and selling official reserves
	- Changing interest rates
	- Imports controls
- Example of pegged or fixed exchange rate is the Hong Kong Dollar against the US dollar
- If the demand for Hong Kong dollars falls meaning the currency depreciates , the Hong Kong's central bank (HKMA) must intervene.
### Official reserve
- The HKMA can sell some of its foreign currency reserve to increase demand back
![[Pasted image 20241001131054.png|400]]
### Changing interest rates
- Increasing domestic interest rates will raise the demand for HK dollars, as the return of saving in HK dollars increase

# Managed Exchange Rate
- **Managed Exchange rate**  - Incorporates elements of floating an fixed exchange rate, where the currency is primarily subject to free market forces, with occasional central bank or government intervention to prevent large fluctuations
- similar to floating exchange rate system, but the central bank intervenes to keep a range known as a crawling peg, also sometimes known as dirty float
![[Pasted image 20241001131754.png|400]]
- The European central bank (ECB) occasionally buy or sell currencies to keep their exchange rate within the bounds
	- When exchange rate is closer to upper bound, ECB may occasionally buy foreign currencies
		- to increase supply of Euros
	- When exchange rate is close to its lower bound, the ECB may occasionally sell its foreign reserves to buy back its Euro
		- increasing demand
- **Overvalued currency** - currency that has been managed at a value higher than its true floating exchange rate value
- **Undervalued currency** - currency that has been managed at a value lower than its true floating exchange rate value
- Consequences of overvalued and undervalue are similar to depreciation/devaluation and appreciation/revaluation
