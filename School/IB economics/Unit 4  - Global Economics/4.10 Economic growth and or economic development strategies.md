- Including:
	- trade strategies
	- market-based policies

# Trade strategies
- Primary sector output tend to generate lower revenue than secondary or tertiary. 
- Since ELDCs heavily rely on primary, in the long term, such trading strategies often worsen economic conditions
- Trade strategies to promote economic growth and development include
	- import substitution
	- Export promotion
	- Economic integration
## Import substitution
- **Import substitution** - Encourages domestic production and consumption through protectionist measures such as tariffs and quotas. 
- often used to protect infant industries
#### Advantages 
- Increased domestic production and employment
- Resilience from external shocks
- Fewer imports lead to reduce transportation costs, and a reduction in final price of goods
#### Disadvantages
- Trade protection distorts the market forces, leading to economic inefficiency
- Consumers are worse off as choice decrease and prices increase
- Reduced competition may result in lower quality products and a lack of innovation
- Restrictive trade practices leads to retaliation from other countries. 
## Export promotion
- **Export promotion** - focuses on supporting domestic producers who engage in export activities to achieve economic growth and development
#### Advantages
- Access to larger markets
- Economies of scale
- Greater diversification
- Investments in human and physical capital raises a country's productive capacity
- Foreign currency is generated to pay for import expenditures
#### Disadvantages
- Over-dependence on export sector
- High income nations may use protectionist measures.
- Opportunity csot of government expenditure to support export promotion.
- Other areas of government spending may be affected
## Economic Integration
- **Economic integration** - Process in which countries cooperate and coordinate their economic policies, increasing linkage between economies involved.
- Often achieved through reduction or elimination barriers.
- Countries can integrate economically through PTAs, trading blocs, or monetary union
#### Advantages
- Greater choice of goods and services
- Lower prices
- More investments between countries, leading to higher employment
- Economies of scale
- Stable business environment in the long run due to improved political relationships
#### Disadvantages
- Loss of autonomy in policy-making
- The country may have to impose common trade restriction non-member countries, causing prices of imports to rise
## Diversification 
- **Diversification** - Process in which countries increase the variety of goods and services produced usually by expanding the secondary and tertiary sectors . 
#### Advantages
- Address problems of over-specialization while creating employment opportunities
- Volitality of primary prices is reduced - stable income
- More efficient use of scarce resources in ELDCs
- Reduce effects from external supply shocks 
#### Disadvantages
- High risks of failure as ELDCs lack the experience and expertise to diversify
- Higher costs due to broader range of products produced by domestic firms 
- Long term plans are required
## Social enterprise
- **Social enterprise** - Organization that focuses on meeting social objectives such as improving social and environmental well-being, rather than aiming to maximize profits 
#### Advantages
- Encourages volunteers and civic commitment
- Attention from the media, raising awareness to support ELDCs to achieve development
- Government support help encourage widespread participation
#### Limitations
- Limited funding
- Volunteers may not be committed and skillful enough
- Thorough accounting and reporting system must be maintained, and activities are closely audited
- Organizations may lack the profit incentive to achieve development goals. 
# Market-based policies
- **Market-base policies** - focus on removing intervention policies and increasing market incentives to improve a country's productive capacity
- **Trade liberalization** - encourages free trade by reducing trade barriers.
	- encourages competition and greater efficiency in international markets
- **Privatization** - selling of state-owned enterprises to private sectors. 
	- Firms can be driven to cut costs and increase profits, improving efficiency and productivity 
- **Deregulation** - reduction or elimination of regulations in order to lower the costs of production for firms
	- encourages competition and greater efficiency 

## Interventionist Policies
- **Interventionist policies** - involve government intervention to correct market failures and drive socially desirable outcomes to promote economic growth and development. 
- Some covered before are:
#### Redistribution policies
- Progressive taxation 
- Transfer payments
- Minimum wages
#### Provision of public and merit goods
- Education
- Healthcare
- Infrastructure
## Inward foreign direct investment (FDI)
- **Inward FDI** - occurs when countries attract long-term capital expenditure from multinational corporations (MNCs), ultimately promoting economic growth and development 
#### Benefits of FDI for MNCs may include:
- Cheaper production costs in lower income countries
- Economies of scale enjoyed by operating on a larger scale 
- Access to natural resources that can be exploited for production 
- Increased sales revenue in fast-growing economies
- Avoid trade barriers by locating in foreign countries 
- Logistical reason - to reduce delivery times to customers in ELDCs
- Financial incentives - governments offer tax breaks, grants, subsidies to MNCs to attract FDI
#### Advantages for host countries:
- major source fo national income for ELDCs
- Higher national income helps ELDCs break out of the poverty cycle
- Higher tax revenues transfer of knowledge, skills and practice from MEDCs to ELDCs
- Greater employment opportunities
- Higher productivity and efficiency for domestic firms due to the competition from MNCs
#### Disadvantages for host countries:
- MNCs may utilize their own management team, reducing the benefits of skill transfers
- MNCs may exploit workers or natural resources in ELDCs
- Profits generated by MNCs are partially repatriated back to their home country
- Domestic firms may be unable to compete with MNC, resulting in unemployment 
- Growing influence of  MNCs create a loss in cultural, political and economic identiy of ELDCs
# Foreign aid
- **Foreign aid** - **concessional** and **non-commercial** assistance in the form of finance, goods and services granted to ELDCs with the goal of improving economic, social, or political conditions.

- **Project aid** - For specific development projects
- **Programme aid** For specific industries
#### Debt relief
- **Debt relief** - total or partial remission of foreign debts.
	- Common for ELDCs to be heavily indebted due to high interest rates charged by creditors. 
#### Official development assistance (ODA)
- Official development assistance - given by foreign governmetns rather than non-profit organizations, for development purposes. 
	- Foreign aid through ODA can be provided bilaterally or channelled through multilateral development agency
- Bilateral - money goes directly 
- through multilateral development agency - money funnels through the world bank first. 
#### Non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
- **Non-governmental organizations** - private organizations which aim to pursue social objectives of improving economic, environmental and social conditions. 
	- Some large NGOs have highly trained workforces and a significant reach with governments around the world. 
#### Advantages and disadvantages of Foreign Aid
##### Advantages
- Helps ELDCs to escape from poverty cycle by increasing production and productivity
- Eradicates extreme poverty 
- Reduces inequalities and unemployment in ELDCs
##### Disadvantages
- ELDCs may be economically dependent on donors 
- Misuse of aid by corrupt governments
- Concessionary loans incurs interest payments
- Economic development should be based on higher volumes of trade, but not on foreign aid
- The type of aid may not be appropriate to the country as it can involve political interferences
## Multilateral development assistance
- **Multilateral development assistance** - financial aid delivered through international institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
- Seen as less political form of foreign aid
- Usually takes the form of non-concessionary loans which incurs interests and repayment periods determined by the market
#### The World Bank

- **Mobile banking** - allows greater ease of access to financial services and reduces "shoe leather costs" for individuals and businesses
#### Increasing women's empowerment 
- Countries with lower female empowerment often have lower productivity and slower growth as gender inequality limits the quantity and quality of half of the labour force. 
- Also deprives women of economic and financial independence.

	1. Improve healthcare and education gaps
	2. Improve access to employment
	3. Increase agency to decision making
#### Reducing corruption
