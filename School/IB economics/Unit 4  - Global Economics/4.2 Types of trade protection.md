# Trade Protection
- **Trade protection** - Refers to government policies which aim to restrict imports to protect domestic producers
	- includes tariffs, subsidies, and administrative barriers
## Tariffs
- **Tariffs** - taxes imposed on imports. 
	- makes domestic goods and services more price competitive and attractive for domestic consumes. 
![[Market_for_steel_tariff.png|400]]

- Due to tariff.
	- $S_{world}$ shifts upwards by $T$ 
	- $Q_d$ decreases from $Q_2 \to Q_4$
	- $Q_s$ increases from $Q_1 \to Q_3$
- Tariff causes quantity of imports to fall from $Q_2 - Q_1 \to Q_4 - Q_3$
### Effects on stakeholders
#### Domestic producs
- Better off as they sell a higher quantity at high price 
#### Consumers 
- Worse off as they pay a highe price at lower quantity 
#### Foreign producers 
- Worse off as they sell at a lower qunatity at the same price 
#### The government 
- earn tax revenue of $T \cdot (Q_4 - Q_3)$
#### Total welfare 
- Decreases. 
- more units are being produced

## Quotas 
- **Import quotas** - legal limit on the quantity or value of imports allowed into a country over a time period. 
---
- Suppose the US government imposes a quota of X tonnes of steel per year
![[market for steel with a quota.png|400]]
- Import falls from ($Q_2 - Q_1$) to Quota X = (Q_3 - Q_1)
- A new supply curve consisting of domestic and foreign producers is formed, $S_d + quota$
- A shortage of $Q_2 - Q_3$ arises $P_w$
- The shortage exerts upward price pressure on the market, and price increases from $P_w \to P_q$ 
- $Q_d$ falls from $Q_2 \to Q_4$
- $Q_s$ rises from $Q_1 \to Q_1 + (Q_4 - Q_3)$
### Effect on Stakeholders

#### Domestic producers
- Better off as they sell a higher quantity and at a higher price 
#### consumers 
- worse off as they pay a higher price and consume a lower quantity 
#### Foreign producers 
- May generate higher or lower sales revenues depending on the PED, PES, and size of the quota
#### Government
- Does not earn revenue 
#### Total welfare 
- More units of products are being produced by the relatively inefficient producers, and consumers must pay a higher price while consuming a lower quantity.

## Production subsidies
![[Production subsidy for steel.png|400]]
- Supply shifts out from $S_d \to S_{d+sub}$
- Quantity supplied from domestic producers increase from $Q_1 \to QS3$
- Domestic producers sell at $P_w$ to consumers but receive $P_{w +sub}$
- Imports fall from $Q_2 - Q_1 \to Q_2 - Q_3$
### Effects on stakeholders

#### domestic producers 
- better off as they sell at higher quantity and receive a higher price
#### consumers
- Unaffected by the subsidy
#### Foreign producers 
generate lower sales revenues due to falling exports
#### The government / tax payers
- Must pay for the subsidy
#### Total welfare
- Decreases 
- More units are being produced by the relatively inefficient producers, leading to a mis-allocation of resources

## Export subsidies 
- **Export subsidies** - sum of money which the government provides to domestic producers for each unit of the subsidized good exported
---
![[Export subsidy steel.png|400]]
- At $P_w$, domestic producers export at $Q_2-Q_1$
- Suppose the US government provides a subsidy per tonne of steel exported
- Domestic supply shift outwards to $S_{d +sub}$
- Domestic producers now receive $P_{w+sub}$ per tonne of steel and supply $Q_4$
- Since Domestic producers receive $P_{w + sub}$ for selling to foreign buyers, there is no incentive to sell to domestic consumers at $P_w$ 
- Thus domestic buyers must also pay $P_{w+sub}$ to acquire steel
- At $P_{w+sub}$, domestic consumers reduce quantity demanded to $Q_3$
- Exports subsequently increases to $Q_4 - Q_3$
![[Effect on stakeholders export subsidy.png]]
#### Domestic producers 
- Better off as they sell a higher quantity and receive a higher price
#### Consumers 
- Worse off as they pay a higher price and consume a lower quantity
#### Foreign producers 
- i.e other exporting countries lose a portion of the market and are worse off.
#### The government / taxpayers 
- Must pay for the subsidy 
#### Total welfare
- Decreases
- More units of products are being produced by the relatively inefficient producers, leading to a mis-allocation of resources
## Administrative barriers
- **Administrative barriers** - Bureaucratic regulations which increases the cost, difficulty, and time required to import foreign goods and services. 
- i.e. embargoes, licensing requirements, and product quality standards.
