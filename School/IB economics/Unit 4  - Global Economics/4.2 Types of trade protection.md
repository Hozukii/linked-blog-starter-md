# Trade Protection
- **Trade protection** - Refers to government policies which aim to restrict imports to protect domestic producers
	- includes tariffs, subsidies, and administrative barriers
## Tariffs
- **Tariffs** - taxes imposed on imports. 
	- makes domestic goods and services more price competitive and attractive for domestic consumes.

- Due to tariff.
	- $S_{world}$ shifts upwards by $T$ 
	- $Q_d$ decreases from $Q_2 \to Q_4$
	- $Q_s$ increases from $Q_1 \to Q_3$
- Tariff causes quantity of imports to fall from $Q_2 - Q_1 \to Q_4 - Q_3$
### Effects on stakeholders
#### Domestic producs
- Better off as they sell a higher quantity at high price 
#### Consumers 
- Worse off as they pay a highe price at lower quantity 
#### Foreign producers 
- Worse off as they sell at a lower qunatity at the same price 
#### The government 
- earn tax revenue of $T \cdot (Q_4 - Q_3)$
#### Total welfare 
- Decreases. 
- more units are being produced

## Quotas 
- **Import quotas** - legal limit on the quantity or value of imports allowed into a country over a time period. 
---
- Suppose the US government imposes a quota of X tonnes of steel per year

- Import falls from ($Q_2 - Q_1$) to Quota X = (Q_3 - Q_1)
- A new supply curve consisting of domestic and foreign producers is formed, $S_d + quota$
- A shortage of $Q_2 - Q_3$ arises $P_w$
- The shortage exerts upward price pressure on the market, and price increases from $P_w \to P_q$ 
- $Q_d$ falls from $Q_2 \to Q_4$
- $Q_s$ rises from $Q_1 \to Q_1 + (Q_4 - Q_3)$
### Effect on Stakeholders
#### Domestic producers
- Better off as they sell a higher quantity and at a higher price 
#### consumers 
- worse off as they pay a higher price and consume a lower quantity 
#### Foreign producers 
- May generate higher or lower sales revenues depending on the PED, PES, and size of the quota
#### Government
- Does not earn revenue 
#### Total welfare 
- More units of products are being produced by the relatively inefficient producers, and consumers must pay a higher price while consuming a lower quantity.
