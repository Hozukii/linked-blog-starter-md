# 2.7 Role of Government in Microeconomics

# Reasons for government intervention

1. Earn government revenue
2. Support firms
3. Support households on low incomes
4. Influence the level of production
5. Influence the level of consumption 
6. Correct market failure
7. Promote equity

## Earn government revenue

- Government revenue may come from various sources of intervention:
    - Tax from direct and indirect taxes
    - State-owned enterprises
    - Privatization
    - Sovereign wealth funds
    - Public sector borrowing

## Support Firms

- The government may offer support to firms for various reasons:
    - Subsidies to lower their production costs and encourage
    - Protecting domestic infant industries
    - Research and development funding
    - Business development loans
    - Tax concessions

## Support households on low incomes

- Free markets lead to unequal income distribution. Government intervention can help to support the basic needs of low-income groups and to reduce excessive income inequality with policies such as education subsidies, progressive taxes, and transfer payments

## Influence the level of production and consumption

- it can increase production and consumption of socially desire goods(e.g. infrastructure, education, and healthcare)
- It can decrease the production and consumption of socially undesirable goods. (e.g. tobacco products, and alcohol)

## Correct market failure

- Government intervention takes place when the market fails to allocate resources efficiently, may involve:
    - Provision of public goods
    - Decrease in production and consumption of demerit goods
    - increase in production and consumption of merit goods
    - Reduction in monopoly power

## Promote equity

- **Equity** - condition of being fair and just
- Government may be required to ensure equitable opportunities for different economic stakeholds such as:
    - Anti-discrimination laws and regulations
    - Progressive taxation to reduce excessive income inequalities
    - Transfers payments made to vulnerable groups

## Forms of government intervention

# Price controls

- **Price controls -** forms of government intervention that sets the maximum or minimum price that producers can charge for certain goods or cervices

# Price ceiling

- **Price ceiling** - legal maximum price set by the government for a particular goods or service to make goods

## Market impacts

### Price ceiling on staple goods

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%201.png)

- A price ceiling is set below equilibrium price
    - Quantity supplied contract-
    - Quantity demanded expands
    - A **shortage** of Qd- Qs arises in the market.
- The shortage encourages the emergence of **black markets.**
- some buyers may purchase goods at Pc and resell the good at a higher price in the black market for a profit

## Impact on stakeholder

- pay a lower price
- Consume lower quantities
- Some consumers who can obtain the good at the lower price are better off
- Some consumers who are unable to obtain the good are worse off

<aside>
üí° The net change in consumer surplus depends on the PED and PES and the size of the price ceiling

### Producer Surplus

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%204.png)

- Total revenue decreases (P*Q* to PcQs)
- Producer surplus decreases

**Workers**

- Decrease in output reduces the demand for labour

# Price Floor

**Price floor -** the legal minimum price set by the government for a particular good or service, to protect the income of producers and workers, or to discourage consumption. 

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%205.png)

- this achieves the government objective of reducing alcohol consumption in order to reduce the associated social costs
- A price floor imposed on the labour market is known as a minimum wage. This aims to
ensure workers have sufficient income to support basic needs.

### Producer

- Reduced quantity sold
- Producer revenue changes from (Q* x P*) to (Qd x Pf)
- If the government buys up the surplus, producers can earn greater total revenue
- If the producers store up the surplus, they incur storage costs

### Consumer

- Pay higher prices
- Reduced quantity consumed
- Total expenditure changes
- Consumer surplus decrease

# Indirect Tax

- **Indirect tax -** type of tax ****imposed on the expenditure of goods and services, paid to the government through producers.
    - **Excise tax -** type of indirect tax imposed on the expenditure of certain goods and services. (e.g, Sugar, gasoline, and tobacco. )

## Why do governments impose indirect taxes?

### Source of government revenue

- Tax revenue can be collected from indirect taxes. They are often imposed on goods with low price elasticity of demand.

### Decrease consumption of harmful goods

- Consumption of demerit goods may be discouraged through

### Improve allocation of resources

- Provision of certain goods leads to market failure and allocative inefficiency.

## Types of indirect tax

### Specific tax

- A fixed dollar amount is imposed on each unit of output
- Amount of tax paid is independent of the price of the good

### Ad-valorem tax (supplementary information)

- A fixed percentage amount is imposed on each unit of output
- As the price of the good increases, the amount of tax paid increases

- The supply shifts upwards by the taxed amount

## Consumers

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%2010.png)

- Price paid increases
- Quantity demanded contracts
- Inefficiencies as customers pay higher prices
and receive lower quantities.

## Producers

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%2011.png)

- The price received by producers decreases
- Quantity transacted decreases

![Untitled](2%207%20Role%20of%20Government%20in%20Microeconomics%208cd02ca7e768451581fae489b8f762cd/Untitled%2012.png)

### Workers

- Lower output causes lower demand for labour
- Unemployment is likely to rise

# Subsidy

**Subsidy -** A form of financial aid given by the government, usually to producers in order to reduce the costs of production, increase output, and reduce prices. 

## Why does the government provide subsidies

- To reduce production costs of merit goods and to correct market failures
    - e.g healthcare services and education producers are encouraged to increase the supply of socially desirable goods and services
- To lower the cost of living for individuals and households
    - The government may provide necessities.
- To increase the international competitiveness of domestic firms
    - Export subsidies help protect domestic firms that are competing in the international market.

- the supply curve shifts downwards by the amount of the subsidy
- Equilibrium falls
- the equilibrium quantity increases
- The price recieved by producers increase from P1 to P3

- The benefits of the subsidy are shared by both consumers and producers
- Producer‚Äôs share + consumer‚Äôs share = government subsidy expenditure

# Direct Provision of services

**Direct provision of services -** public and merit goods are often under consumed / produced in a free market. Direct provision occurs when the government directly supplies goods or services in the best interest of the society. 

**Public goods -** provided by the government. Private firms cannot prevent ‚Äúfree riders‚Äù using public goods without paying.

**command and control legislation -** refer to the laws governing certain activities or industries.
