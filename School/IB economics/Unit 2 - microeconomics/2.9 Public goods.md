**Public goods -** goods and services that are **non-rivalrous** and **non-excludable**
#### Non-rivalrous
- Consumption of the good by additional consumers does not diminish the ability of others to enjoy said good.
#### Non-excludable
- Once the good is provided, producers cannot exclude anyone from enjoying and benefiting from the good, even if the have not paid.
# Types of goods

- All goods and services can be placed on the spectrum below. **Quasi-public goods** may exhibit characteristics of both private and public goods
- e.g. public beaches are non-excludable but may become rivalrous.

## Private goods

- **Private goods** are both **rivalrous** and **excludable**
## Free-rider problem

- Non-excludability characteristic of public goods prevents profit-maximizing firms from providing such goods as they cannot charge consumers. This is known as the **free rider problem** where the public can enjoy the benefits of a good without paying for it.
- Therefore, in a free-market, there would be an **under-allocation** of resources towards public goods

# Government intervention in response to public goods

- To prevent public goods from being underproduced, the government may provide public goods through **direct provision** and **contracting out** to the private sector.
## Direct provision of public goods

- **Direct provision** occurs when the government directly supplies certain goods and services to the public.

- Direct provision by the government is necessary because:
	- Public goods would be under-provided or even not provided in a free market.
	- It enables large-scale productions and economies of scale
	- Public goods improve the well-being of individuals and societies
- However, there are also arguments against direct provision:
	- Significant cost to finance public goods, which is funded through taxation
	- Opportunity cost issue arises
	- Government failure in intervening in markets as they may not know what is best for society
## Contracting out
- **Contracting out** occurs when the government pays a specialist private producer with the expertise to produce the public good

**advantages**
- Usually done by a competitive tendering process to encourage lower costs and higher quality.
- Access to specialist knowledge, skills, and capital in the private sector

**Disadvantages**
- Government loses a degree of control over public goods
- Cost of contracting may be greater than direct provision
- Heavily dependent on the quality of work done by the contracted firm
- Additional monitoring costs
