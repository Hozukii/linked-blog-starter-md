**Elasticity -** the measure of the responsiveness of a variable as a result of a change in another variable.
**Elasticity of demand -** measures the response in quantity demanded in a market as a result of factors such as income or price 
# The concept of elasticity
- Demand is price **inelastic** when a change in price leads to *proportionally lower* change in quantity demanded.

### Revenue
$\text {total revenue} = P \cdot Q$
- if demand is price inelastic it is always more profitable to raise the price because it is proportional.
- If demand is price elastic raising prices will lead to decrease in profit significantly
# Price Elast12icity of Demand (PED)
- Measures the elasticity
#### $$PED = \dfrac {\text{\% change in quantity demanded of a good}}{\text{\% change in the price of a good}} = \dfrac {\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta P}$$
- percentage is measured :
#### $$\text {percentage change} = \dfrac {\text{new price - old price}}{\text{old price}}$$
- PEDs is = $\frac{1}{gradient}$
- if the gradient is *smaller* than 1 it is elastic
- if the gradient is *bigger* than 1 it is inelastic
--- 
- Mathematically, demand is price **elastic** if:
	$PED > 1$
- Demand is price **inelastic** if:
	$PED < 1$
# Theoretical range of values for PED
- There are special cases where the PED value stays constant

# Determinants of PED
The determinants of ped can be remembered as : HINTS
**H -** Habits
**I -** income
**N -** Necessity
**T -** Time
**S -** Substitutes
# Impact of PED on the decision-making of firms
### Revenue maximization
- If **inelastic**, firms can *increase* price to increase total revenue
- If **elastic**, firms can *reduce* price to increase total revenue
- Firms can adjust prices

# Impact of PED on the decision-making of firms
- Firms face different market segments with differing PED
- Firms can charge higher prices for price inelastic segments, and lower prices for price elastic segments to try and maximize revenue.
### Dynamic pricing
- Families with kids might be restricted to the school holidays, therefore consumers are less price sensitive while reducing prices during off seasons where consumers are more sensitive.
### Taxation policies
- When demand is **price elastic,** governments can tax price elastic demand to effectively discourage its consumption without a significant tax burden.
- When demand is **price inelastic,** governments can tax price inelastic demand, such as cigarettes and alcohol, as a source of government revenue.
# Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)
- Income in economics is written as **Y**
- **Income elasticity of demand** measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in real income of consumers. 
	- What kind of change to its demand when real income changes?
- It is calculated using the formula:
#### $$PED = \dfrac {\text{\% change in quantity demanded of a good}}{\text{\% change in real income}} = \dfrac {\%\Delta Qd}{\%\Delta Y}$$

**real income -** income after adjusting for inflation
- YED can either be *positive or negative* depending on the type of good.
## Normal goods
- **normal goods -** goods with a positive YED value, where demand increases as consumer income increases.
- Normal goods can be separated into necessities and luxury goods
    - Luxury goods are goods and services used to satisfy wants and indulgences
## Inferior goods
- **Inferior goods** are goods and services with more expensive and higher quality substitutes.
### Interpretations of YED
>[!info] Necessities
>**inelastic** when  0 < YED < 1
>- Ex: toothpaste, toilet paper, staple foods
>- Consumer demand *does no increase or decrease* significantly with changes in income

>[!note] Luxury goods
>**Elastic** when YED < 1
>- mechanical watches, designer clothing's, sports cars
>- Demand changes *proportionately greater* to the change in income

>[!hint] inferior goods
>YED < 0
>- ex: microwave meals, instant noodles, second-hand clothing
>- As income rises, demand for inferior goods *fall* as consumers are more willing and able to purchase better alternatives

# Engel Curve

![Untitled|350](2%205%20Elasticity%20of%20demand%20eb8db11f1cce42f39101e2e6cfd2ea7d/Untitled%207.png)
**The Engel Curve** - a visual representation of the relationship between income and quantity demanded. 
- income is real income
- Y1 - at income is low, bread is a luxury good and demand is low
- Y2 - at Y2 income rises and it becomes more of a necessity
- Y3 - As income increases, bread is now a necessity good
- Y4 - As income increase, demand can decrease since there can be higher quality substitutes meaning it becomes a inferior good. 
--- 
- Low income - demand is elastic
- middle income - demand is inelastic
- High income - demand is negative, inferior good
## Impact of YED on the decision making of economic agents
- YED can be used for estimating the impact of changes in the business cycle, hence income, on different markets:
    - **Necessities** are less affected by business cycle fluctions; demand stay relatively constant
    - **Luxury goods** are subject to the highest volatility in demand: proportionately stronger demand during economic booms and proportionately weaker demand in recessions
    - **Inferior goods** are **counter-cyclical.** For example, supermarkets can have more canned goods during a recession and reduce canned good and increase fresh goods during a boom
