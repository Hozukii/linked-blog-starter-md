- **Supply** is concerned with the behaviour of firms(producers)
- The quantities of a good or service that producers are willing and able to produce at different prices at a certain period of time.
# Individual Supply
There are to types to show the 
Individual supply can be represented in different ways:
- Supply Schedule

- Supply Curve

## Individual supply to market supply
- The sum of individual will be the **market supply**
- Market supply shows the total quantity of a good or service that firms are willing and able to
supply in the market at different possible prices, ceteris paribus.
# Law of Supply
- states there is a positive relationship between the price of a good and it’s quantity supplied over a particular period, ceteris paribus.
- **Higher prices** generally means that producer profits increasing.
    - Firms are have incentive to create more outputs and new firms want to enter the market
- **Lower prices** generally means lower profitability.
    - Firms have less incentive to produce.
# Non-price Determinants of supply.
Includes but not limited to:
**S** - Subsidies and taxes
**T** - Technology
**O** - Other related goods’ price 
**R** - resource costs 
**E** - Expectations(of producers)
**S** - Size of market
### Subsidies and indirect taxes.
-**Subsidies -** financial aids provided by the government to producers to encourage output.

- **Indirect taxes -** government charges on producers to discourage output.

### Change in Technology
- Advances in technology increase efficiency and productivity, thus lowering costs.
- Supply of goods and services increase at every price level, shifting the supply curve to the right.

### Competitive Supply
- When two goods are in **competitive supply,** the output of one product is limited by the other product due to shared resources. Producers have scarce resources.
- For a farmer, an Increase in output of tomatoes can mean decrease in the supply of potatoes if farmed on shared land and labour

### Joint Supply
- When two goods are in **joint supply,** increase output in one goods increase the supply of another good.  (like complementary goods)

### Resources costs
- Costs of production including wages, rent, interest, and profit, are negatively correlated with supply
### Expectations of producers
- There is a positive correlation between future price expectations and the supply of the good.
- Example: Airline company expects demand for flights to worsen during a recession or pandemic, they may decrease the number of flights offered.
### Size of market
- There is positive correlation between the number of firms in a market and the market supply of a product
# Shifts in supply
- changes in non-determinants of supply cause shifts in the supply corve
- An outward shift indicates that more quantity is supplied at all prices
- An inward shift indicates less quantity is supplied at all prices

### Movements vs Shifts
**movement** are due to price changes, causing changes in quantity supplied
![Untitled|350](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%202%20Supply%20dbfcf31f94764fe2b9727aebf240ee67/Untitled%208.png)
- **Shifts** are due to changes in non-price determinants, causing changes in supply
