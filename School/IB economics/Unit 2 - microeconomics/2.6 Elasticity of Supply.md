**Price elasticity of supply** measures the responsiveness of a quantity supplied in a market as a result of a change in price
#### $$
PES = \frac{\text{percentage change in quantity supplied}}{\text {Percentage change in price}} = \frac{\% \Delta Qs}{\% \Delta P}
$$
$PES \ge 0$
# Relatively Inelastic Supply
![[Relatively inelastic supply.png]]
- When a change in price leads to a proportionally *smaller* change in quantity supplied, supply is **relatively price inelastic.** A relatively inelastic supply curve will intersect the Q axis
# Relatively Elastic Supply
![[Relatively elastic supply.png]]
- When a change in price leads to a *proportionally greater change* in quantity supplied, supply is **relatively price elastic.** A relatively price elastic supply curve will intersect the P-axis
# Unitary Elastic Supply
![[Unitary elastic supply.png]]
- A supply curve passing through the origin will always have a PES of 1 i.e., **unitary** **elastic**. this can be explained through the PES formula.
$$
PES = \frac{\% \Delta Qs}{\% \Delta P}
$$
- As the price and the quantity supplied are directly proportional the percentage change in quantity supplied will always have equal the percentage change in price.
# Perfectly Elastic Supply
![[Perfectly price elastic supply.png]]
- A horizontal supply curve is **perfectly price elastic.** This is only the case when marginal costs are constant and there are no limits on productive capacity. For perfectly elastic supply it is infinite
- e.g. computer games
# Perfectly Inelastic Supply
![[Perfectly price inelastic supply.png]]
- A vertical supply curve is **perfectly price inelastic**
- Supply is fixed, where producers are only able and willing to supply at Q irrespective of the price
$$
PES = \frac{\% \Delta Qs}{\% \Delta P} = \frac{0}{\% \Delta P} = 0
$$
- An example of perfectly inelastic supply are seats in a sports stadium.
# Determinants of PES
**T -** Time
**R** - Rate at which costs increase 
**I** - inventory
**C** - Capacity
**S** - Substitute Factors of productions
### Time
- Supply tends to be inelastic in the short term because of the delay
	- Time is required to produce the product
	- Time is required to obtain more factors of production
	- Time is needed to distribute goods to consumers
- Over time, supply becomes more elastic and responsive
### Rate at which costs increase
- marginal cost is the cost incurred of producing one additional unit.
- $MC = \frac{\Delta TC}{\Delta Q}$
- Due to laws of diminishing returns, marginal costs will rise as production increases, Hence firms will only produce at P = $AR \ge MC$  to make a profit
- AS a Result, the PES of a firm is dependent on how quickly marginal costs rise
	- If mc rises **slowly,** supply is **more** elastic as small increases in price stimulate production
	- IF MC rises **quickly,** supply is **less** price elastic so larger increases in price are needed.
### Inventory
**Inventory** - the stocks of unused raw materials, work-in-progress goods, and finished goods. Firms that are able to hold inventory can respond quickly to an increase in price and can hold more inventory when price falls.
- As a result: 
	- Firms who are able to hold inventory have relatively price elastic supply
	- Firms who cannot hold inventory have relatively inelastic supply.
### Unused Capacity
**Unused capacity** - spare available resources a firm has but does not utilise. Firms that choose to have spare capacity can increase production following an increase in price, or decrease production following a fall in price
- Firms that choose to operate at or near full capacity are less price elastic
### Factor Mobility
**Factor Mobility -** firmâ€™s ability to substitutes factors of productions in the production process
- As an resutlt, firms with mobile factors of production is more elastic in their supply while firms with less ability to substitute factors of production are relatively price inelastic.
- as primary commodities are often land or labour intensive, primary sector producers suffer a higher degree  of geographical and occupational immobility.
- Additionally, capital such as oil drills, harvesters, and tractors are more specialised and have fewer substitutes.
- Secondary manufactured goods have more flexible and adaptable capital. Land factors such as different plastics and metals have many substitutes.
