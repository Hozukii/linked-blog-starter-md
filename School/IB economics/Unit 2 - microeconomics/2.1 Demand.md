# The law of demand
- It states that there is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded.
- As the price of a product increases, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa.
# Non-price determinants of demand
- **Non-price determinants of demand** are factors that may influence demand. This includes but not limited to:
    - Income
    - Taste & Preference
    - The future price expectations
    - Price of related goods
    - Numbers of consumers
### Income
- **Normal goods** see an increase in demand as consumer income rise, vice versa. Such as everyday necessities such as regular food items and clothing, and luxury products such as sports cars and designer wear
- **Inferior goods** see a decrease in demand as consumer income rise, and vice versa. Such as secondhand clothes and canned goods.
### Tastes and preference
- Changes in consumer tastes and preferences may be caused by social and cultural changes.
### Future price expectations
- Some may purchase the good at the current time period at a comparatively lower price resulting in a increase in current demand.
### Price of related goods
- Related goods experience a change in demand from a change in the price of associated product
- There are two categories
    - **Substitute** are goods that can replace each other.
    - **Complements** are goods used in conjunction
        - When price of a complementary goods increase, the associated product’s demand decreases.
### Numbers of consumers
- The number of consumers in a market has a positive relationship with demand.
# Illustrating shifts in demand
Demand increase if the line moves rightward / outwards. There are more quantity demanded for the price. 
Demand decreases if the line moves leftwards / inwards.

- **Movements** along the demand curve are due to changes in price resulting in change in quantity demanded

**shifts** in the demand curve are due to changes in non-price determinants resulting in changes in demand.
