**market failure** - occurs due to an inefficient allocation of resources.
- The signalling, incentive, and rationing functions of the price mechanism may not always lead to a socially optimal outcome.

# Key terms - benefits and costs

-**marginal private benefit (MPB) -** additional benefits to consumers from an extra unit output (demand)
- **marginal social benefit (MSB) -** total benefits to society from an extra unit of output (demand)
- **Marginal private cost (MPC) -** additional costs paid by producers from an extra unit of output (supply)
- **marginal social cost (MSC) -** Total costs paid by society from an extra unit of output
- **marginal external benefit(MEB) -** additional benefits to third parties from an extra unit of output
- **Marginal external cost(MEC) -** additional costs to third parties from an extra unit of output

# Introduction

- Market equilibrium assumes there are **no externalities** in the market and
    - S = MSC = MPC
    - D= MSB = MPB
**externalities** - refers to the spill-over benefits or costs imposed on third parties through economic activities of consumption and production.

- Externalities arise when MSC ≠ MPC or when MSB ≠ MPB, resulting in an under or over allocation of resources and subsequently market failure.

# Positive externalities

**positive externalities -** external benefits imposed to third parties through economic activities
**merit goods** - exclusively refer to goods associated with **positive externalities of consumption**
- The marginal social benefit of a merit good is larger than the marginal private benefit.

## Positive externalities of consumption

**Positive externalities of consumption** - positive spill-over effect generated to third parties as a result of consuming merit goods.

- **Positive externalities of production -** positive spill-over effect generated to third parties as a result of production activities

# Government intervention correcting positive externalities

- Markets associated with positive externalities of consumption or production suffer from an **under-allocation** of resources leading to market failure
- Government intervene by **increasing the allocation of resources** to correct market failure:
    - Legislation and regulation
    - Education and awareness creation
    - direct provision
    - subsidies

### Legislation and regulation

- Laws and regulations are enforced by the government to ensure certain behaviour from consumers and producers
- Examples:
    - compulsory mask wearing
    - Compulsory education
    - Legal requirement for children to receive vaccination against certain diseases

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%203.png)

**advantages**
- Effective in reducing externalities from a command and control approach

**disadvantages** 
- Monitoring and enforcing costs incurred by the government
- political pushback
- people may choose to break the rules if penalties are not significant

### Education - awareness creation

Governments may educate the public about the benefits of merit goods through advertisements, campaigns, and schools to encourage consumption.

![Untitled](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%204.png)

**advantages**
- effective campaigns may change customer behaviour for the long term

**disadvantages**
- Education campaigns only encourage people to change behaviour; effectiveness may vary
- Requires time for the message to be accepted and behaviour to change
- opportunity cost of government spending

## Direct provision
- Governments may directly provide goods and services in the public sector associated with positive externalities such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.

#### Direct provision for positive externalities of consumption

#### Provision for positive externalities of production

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%206.png)

## Subsidies

- Governments may also provide subsidies to producers to reduce the cost of production to encourage production and consumption

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%207.png)

**Advantages**
- Incentivizes production and consumption
- Reduces the price of the good, increasing its affordability to lower income groups

**Disadvantages**

- Imperfect market information - different to accurately calculate the level of subsidy and externalities to achieve socially-optimum output
- Effectiveness is dependent on PED - larger subsidies required for price inelastic products
- Opportunity cost - subsidies require government spending, which always forgone benefits of alternative use.

# Negative Externalities

**Negative Externalities -** external costs imposed on third parties through economic activities
**Demerit goods -** refer to goods associated with negative externalities of **consumption.**  MSC > MPC
## Negative externalities of consumption

**Negative externalities of consumption -** spill-over costs generated to third parties by consumers during consumption activities.

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%209.png)

- Over-allocation of resources resulting in welfare loss and market failure
## Negative Externalities of production

**Negative externalities of production -** spill-over costs generated to third parties by producers during production activities

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2010.png)

- Over-allocation of resources resulting in welfare loss and market failure
## Government intervention correcting negative externalities

- Markets with negative externalities of consumption or production suffer from an **over-allocation.**
- Governments usually **intervene** in such markets by decreasing the allocation of resources to correct the market failure. This may involve
    - Indirect tax
    - Legislation and regulation
    - Education - awareness creation
    - Collective self-governance
    - Carbon taxes
    - Tradable permits
    - International agreements
### Indirect (Pigouvian) tax

- **indirect tax** is placed on the expenditure of goods or services, paid by producers to the government. This helps to **internalize** the external costs with the market participants.

**Advantages**
- The price increase discourages consumption
- The higher cost discourages production
- Tax revenue is generated for the government

**Disadvantages**
- Regressive - low-income groups pay a higher portion of their income for the tax
- Relatively ineffective for goods with inelastic PED
- Imperfect market information means the size of the tax is unlikely equal to the external cost
- Emergence of parallel markets - smuggling activities for demerit goods
### Legislation and regulation

- Laws enforced by the government to ensure certain behaviour from consumers and producers

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2011.png)

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2012.png)

- Very often when trying to eliminate the whole welfare loss and MEC, we can’t eliminate all the way.

**Advantages** 
- Effective in reducing externalities from a command-and-control approach

**Disadvantages**
- Monitoring and enforcing costs incurred by the government
- Political pushback
- People may choose to break the rules if penalties are not high enough

### Education - awareness creation

- The government may also discourage the consumption of demerit goods through education and awareness campaigns so that the public s more aware of the negative effects of the good

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2013.png)
### Collective self-governance

- refers to the voluntary communal actions that combat negative externalities. Successful campaigns may change social norms and cultural behaviours
### Carbon taxes
**carbon emissions** - refers to the release of carbon into the atmosphere and is one of the most common and significant negative externalities which occurs from economic activity

- Imposed on producers or carbon emissions from production activities with the aim of minimizing environmental pollution

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2014.png)

**advantages**
- Long term benefits - create incentives for firms to use cleaner technologies
- Internalize externality - producers and consumers pay for the environmental costs
- Tax revenue generated
- Easily implemented

**Disadvantage**
- Regressive - low-income groups pay a higher portion of their income for the tax
- Ineffective for products with inelastic PED
- Imperfect market information - difficult to accurately calculate the level of externalities and carbon tax in order to achieve the socially-optimum output

### Tradable permits

- **Cap and trade schemes** limits the level of pollutants to a level pre-determined by the governments. Firms are issues **tradable permits** and have the right to pollute up to the level permitted.
- tradable permits can be freely traded between firms
- The more pollutant producers create, the more permits they will need to purchase
- More environmentally-friendly producers may sell their excess permits to gain revenues
- In the long run, this creates incentives for firms to switch to cleaner production technologies

![Untitled|300](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%202%20-%20Microeconomics/Microeconomic%20images/2%208%20Market%20Failure%20-%20externalities%20and%20common%20pool%201eb231eb080e4031980b99d5b0ff3958/Untitled%2015.png)

![Untitled|300](Untitled%2016.png)

- If the government decreases the number of permits, the supply of permits decreases.

**Advantages**
- limits carbon emissions to a pre-determined level
- Greater incentives for firms to switch to clear technologies
- Internalize externality - consumers and producers for external costs
- Flexibility for firms - firms may choose to switch to clean technologies or pay for permits

**Disadvantages**
- Potential job losses due to increased production costs
- Multinational companies may shift production to other countries to avoid permit constraints
- Demands for permits are highly inelastic
- Difficult to determine the socially optimal level of pollutants and permits allowed per year
### Government agreements

- Nations often develop international agreements to combat negative externalities of production

#### Barriers preventing the success of international agreements

- Countries are more concerned with their economic interest instead of environmental costs The reluctance of some major countries to join the agreements that limits the effectiveness
- High-income countries may exploit  low-income countries
### Challenges involved in the measurement of externalities

- It is not possible to accurately quantify externalities.
- Despite this, government intervention aims to steer markets in the right direction by reducing the level of under-allocation or over-allocation or resources.
### Degree of effectiveness

- Since there are many factors affecting the market quantity, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of one particular policy on the market.
- Since there are many factors affecting the market quantity, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of one particular policy on the market.
### Consequences on the stakeholders

- Government interventions create scope of exploitation. For example:
	- Multinational firms relocate to lower-income countries for more lenient regulations on environmental pollutions.
# Common access resources

**Common access resources** - rivalrous and non-excludable resources such as clean air, fish stocks, and trees. Without government intervention, these resources are likely to be overused
## Characteristics of common access resources

**Non-excludable** 
- It is impossible to prevent non-payers from benefitting from the resource. The non-excludability nature of common access resources means that they are over-used

**Rivalrous**
- The consumption of a resource reduces the amount available for others to use. Common access
resources are rivalrous due to scarcity.
## Tragedy of common access resources

**Tragedy of common access resources** - situation where degradation, depletion or destruction of a common access resource is caused by rivalry and over-consumption.

- Common access resources are related to negative externalities of production, where the external cost refers to the threats to sustainability.
## Role of international co-operation

- Owing to the escalating global demand for scarce resources, international co-operation between nation is vital to combat market failures and threats to sustainability on a global level
