- **market failure** - occurs due to an inefficient allocation of resources.
- The signalling, incentive, and rationing functions of the price mechanism may not always lead to a socially optimal outcome.

# Key terms - benefits and costs

- **marginal private benefit (MPB) -** additional benefits to consumers from an extra unit output (demand)
- **marginal social benefit (MSB) -** total benefits to society from an extra unit of output (demand)
- **Marginal private cost (MPC) -** additional costs paid by producers from an extra unit of output (supply)
- **marginal social cost (MSC) -** Total costs paid by society from an extra unit of output
- **marginal external benefit(MEB) -** additional benefits to third parties from an extra unit of output
- **Marginal external cost(MEC) -** additional costs to third parties from an extra unit of output

# Introduction
![[Free market.png|350]]
- Market equilibrium assumes there are **no externalities** in the market and
    - S = MSC = MPC
    - D= MSB = MPB
- **externalities** - refers to the spill-over benefits or costs imposed on third parties through economic activities of consumption and production.
- Externalities arise when MSC ≠ MPC or when MSB ≠ MPB, resulting in an under or over allocation of resources and subsequently market failure.
# Positive externalities
- **positive externalities -** external benefits imposed to third parties through economic activities
- **merit goods** - exclusively refer to goods associated with **positive externalities of consumption**
- The marginal social benefit of a merit good is larger than the marginal private benefit.
## Positive externalities of consumption
**Positive externalities of consumption** - positive spill-over effect generated to third parties as a result of consuming merit goods.

## Positive externalities of production
![[Smart watch market externalities.png|350]]
- **Positive externalities of production -** positive spill-over effect generated to third parties as a result of production activities
# Government intervention correcting positive externalities
- Markets associated with positive externalities of consumption or production suffer from an **under-allocation** of resources leading to market failure
- Government intervene by **increasing the allocation of resources** to correct market failure:
    - Legislation and regulation
    - Education and awareness creation
    - direct provision
    - subsidies
### Legislation and regulation
- Laws and regulations are enforced by the government to ensure certain behaviour from consumers and producers
- Examples:
    - compulsory mask wearing
    - Compulsory education
    - Legal requirement for children to receive vaccination against certain diseases
![[Face masks market externalities.png|350]]
**advantages**
- Effective in reducing externalities from a command and control approach
**disadvantages** 
- Monitoring and enforcing costs incurred by the government
- political pushback
- people may choose to break the rules if penalties are not significant
### Education - awareness creation
Governments may educate the public about the benefits of merit goods through advertisements, campaigns, and schools to encourage consumption.
![[Vaccine market externalities.png|350]]
**advantages**
- effective campaigns may change customer behaviour for the long term
**disadvantages**
- Education campaigns only encourage people to change behaviour; effectiveness may vary
- Requires time for the message to be accepted and behaviour to change
- opportunity cost of government spending
## Direct provision
- Governments may directly provide goods and services in the public sector associated with positive externalities such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure.
#### Direct provision for positive externalities of consumption
![[Direct provision for positive externalities of consumption.png|350]]
#### Provision for positive externalities of production
![[Provision for positive externalities of production.png|350]]
## Subsidies
- Governments may also provide subsidies to producers to reduce the cost of production to encourage production and consumption
![[Subsidy for positive externalities of consumption.png|350]]
**Advantages**
- Incentivizes production and consumption
- Reduces the price of the good, increasing its affordability to lower income groups
**Disadvantages**
- Imperfect market information - different to accurately calculate the level of subsidy and externalities to achieve socially-optimum output
- Effectiveness is dependent on PED - larger subsidies required for price inelastic products
- Opportunity cost - subsidies require government spending, which always forgone benefits of alternative use.

# Negative Externalities
**Negative Externalities -** external costs imposed on third parties through economic activities
**Demerit goods -** refer to goods associated with negative externalities of **consumption.**  MSC > MPC
## Negative externalities of consumption
**Negative externalities of consumption -** spill-over costs generated to third parties by consumers during consumption activities.
![[Negative externalities of consumption.png|350]]
- Over-allocation of resources resulting in welfare loss and market failure
## Negative Externalities of production
**Negative externalities of production -** spill-over costs generated to third parties by producers during production activities
![[Negative externalities of production.png|350]]
- Over-allocation of resources resulting in welfare loss and market failure
## Government intervention correcting negative externalities
- Markets with negative externalities of consumption or production suffer from an **over-allocation.**
- Governments usually **intervene** in such markets by decreasing the allocation of resources to correct the market failure. This may involve
    - Indirect tax
    - Legislation and regulation
    - Education - awareness creation
    - Collective self-governance
    - Carbon taxes
    - Tradable permits
    - International agreements
### Indirect (Pigouvian) tax
- **indirect tax** is placed on the expenditure of goods or services, paid by producers to the government. This helps to **internalize** the external costs with the market participants.
**Advantages**
- The price increase discourages consumption
- The higher cost discourages production
- Tax revenue is generated for the government
**Disadvantages**
- Regressive - low-income groups pay a higher portion of their income for the tax
- Relatively ineffective for goods with inelastic PED
- Imperfect market information means the size of the tax is unlikely equal to the external cost
- Emergence of parallel markets - smuggling activities for demerit goods
### Legislation and regulation
- Laws enforced by the government to ensure certain behaviour from consumers and producers

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

- Very often when trying to eliminate the whole welfare loss and MEC, we can’t eliminate all the way.
**Advantages** 
- Effective in reducing externalities from a command-and-control approach
**Disadvantages**
- Monitoring and enforcing costs incurred by the government
- Political pushback
- People may choose to break the rules if penalties are not high enough
### Education - awareness creation
- The government may also discourage the consumption of demerit goods through education and awareness campaigns so that the public s more aware of the negative effects of the good
![[Education for negative externalities of consumption.png|350]]
### Collective self-governance
- refers to the voluntary communal actions that combat negative externalities. Successful campaigns may change social norms and cultural behaviours
### Carbon taxes
**carbon emissions** - refers to the release of carbon into the atmosphere and is one of the most common and significant negative externalities which occurs from economic activity
- Imposed on producers or carbon emissions from production activities with the aim of minimizing environmental pollution
![[Carbon taxes for negative externalities of production.png|350]]

**advantages**
- Long term benefits - create incentives for firms to use cleaner technologies
- Internalize externality - producers and consumers pay for the environmental costs
- Tax revenue generated
- Easily implemented
**Disadvantage**
- Regressive - low-income groups pay a higher portion of their income for the tax
- Ineffective for products with inelastic PED
- Imperfect market information - difficult to accurately calculate the level of externalities and carbon tax in order to achieve the socially-optimum output
### Tradable permits
- **Cap and trade schemes** limits the level of pollutants to a level pre-determined by the governments. Firms are issues **tradable permits** and have the right to pollute up to the level permitted.
- tradable permits can be freely traded between firms
- The more pollutant producers create, the more permits they will need to purchase
- More environmentally-friendly producers may sell their excess permits to gain revenues
- In the long run, this creates incentives for firms to switch to cleaner production technologies
![[Tradable permits market.png|350]]
![[Shift in tradable permits.png|350]]
- If the government decreases the number of permits, the supply of permits decreases.
**Advantages**
- limits carbon emissions to a pre-determined level
- Greater incentives for firms to switch to clear technologies
- Internalize externality - consumers and producers for external costs
- Flexibility for firms - firms may choose to switch to clean technologies or pay for permits
**Disadvantages**
- Potential job losses due to increased production costs
- Multinational companies may shift production to other countries to avoid permit constraints
- Demands for permits are highly inelastic
- Difficult to determine the socially optimal level of pollutants and permits allowed per year
### Government agreements
- Nations often develop international agreements to combat negative externalities of production
#### Barriers preventing the success of international agreements
- Countries are more concerned with their economic interest instead of environmental costs The reluctance of some major countries to join the agreements that limits the effectiveness
- High-income countries may exploit  low-income countries
### Challenges involved in the measurement of externalities
- It is not possible to accurately quantify externalities.
- Despite this, government intervention aims to steer markets in the right direction by reducing the level of under-allocation or over-allocation or resources.
### Degree of effectiveness
- Since there are many factors affecting the market quantity, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of one particular policy on the market.
- Since there are many factors affecting the market quantity, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of one particular policy on the market.
### Consequences on the stakeholders
- Government interventions create scope of exploitation. For example:
	- Multinational firms relocate to lower-income countries for more lenient regulations on environmental pollutions.
# Common access resources
**Common access resources** - rivalrous and non-excludable resources such as clean air, fish stocks, and trees. Without government intervention, these resources are likely to be overused
## Characteristics of common access resources
**Non-excludable** 
- It is impossible to prevent non-payers from benefitting from the resource. The non-excludability nature of common access resources means that they are over-used
**Rivalrous**
- The consumption of a resource reduces the amount available for others to use. Common access
	- resources are rivalrous due to scarcity.
## Tragedy of common access resources
**Tragedy of common access resources** - situation where degradation, depletion or destruction of a common access resource is caused by rivalry and over-consumption.
- Common access resources are related to negative externalities of production, where the external cost refers to the threats to sustainability.
## Role of international co-operation
- Owing to the escalating global demand for scarce resources, international co-operation between nation is vital to combat market failures and threats to sustainability on a global level
