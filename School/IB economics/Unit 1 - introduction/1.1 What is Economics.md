**W** - well-being
**I** - interdependence
**S** - scarcity
**E** - efficiency
**C** - choices
**I** intervention
**C** - change
**E** - equity
**S** - sustainability 
## Factors of Production
- Factors of production refer to the resources required to produce goods and services
- There are four factors of production: **CELL**
- **Capital -** man-made resources (eg. vehicles, machinery, and infrastructure
- **Enterprise**  - the skill of organizing three factors of production, and coming up with ideas
-  **Land** - natural resources (agricultural land, wood, gold, water, and oil, etcâ€¦)
- **Labour -** human resources 
- Households own the factors of production which are sold to firms in exchange of income
- Capital - interest
- Entrepreneurship - profit
- Land - rent
- Labour - wages
# Circular flow of income
- shows the interaction between households and firm

- exports/ expenses abroad is leakages
- imports / income from exports and services are injection

# Scarcity & the basic economic questions

- Resources are limited but individuals and societies unlimited wants.
- so choices must be made to allocate
1. What to produce?
2. How to produce?
3. For whom to produce for?

# Economic systems

- Free market economy
- Mixed economy
- planned economy

# Opportunity cost

- the value of the next best alternative forgone when a choic is made
- example : a worker decided to go on vacation for a week instead of going to work. The opportunity cost is the lost wages.

## Free Goods

- naturally abundant and unlimited supply therefor no opportunity cost

# The production possibilities curve model (PPC)

- model which illustrated the combinations of goods or services that an economy or firm can produce

 Assumption of the model
- fixed amount of resources
- Only two goods are produced
- Technology and production techniques are fixed
- All resources are used efficiently
### Growth in production possibilities
- an increase in the quantity in factors of production
- an improvement in the quality in factors of production
    - an improvement in technology
