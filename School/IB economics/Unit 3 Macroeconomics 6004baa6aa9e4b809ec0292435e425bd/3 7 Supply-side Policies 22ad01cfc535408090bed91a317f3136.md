# 3.7 Supply-side Policies

## Introduction

- **Supply-side policies** aims to increase aggregate supply and the production capacity of the economy by improving the quality and/or quantity of factors of production.
- There are two major categories of supply-side policie
    - Market based
    - Intervention based
- **Market based policies** involve the removal of existing government policies and encourage free market efficiency
- **Interventionist policies** involve direct government intervention as the free market fails to allocate resources efficiently.

# Goals of supply-side policies

I - international competitiveness

C - Competition and efficiency 

L - Labour market flexibility

I - Incentives

P - Productive capacity

## International competitiveness (reduced inflation)

- An increase in AS lowers general price levels and rate of inflation.
- Lower domestic prices improve the international competitiveness of exports on the international market

## Competition  and efficiency

Policies such as deregulation, privatization, trade liberation, and anti-monopoly regulation all serve to **encourage competition.** 

## Labour market flexibility (reduces labour costs and unemployment)

- Labour market policies such as those aimed at reducing the power o labour unions, reducing unemployment benefits, and abolishing minimum wages serve to increase labour market flexibility
- Greater labour market flexibility lowers labour costs for firms and lowers unemployment; it also improves the efficiency and productivity of the workforce

## Incentives

- **Incentive-related policies** include cuts in personal income tax, business tax, and capital gains.
- reduction in income tax incentivizes workers to increase output
- cuts in business tax and capital gains tax will allow firms to benefit from lower costs.
- The increase in disposable incomes encourages firms to invest in R&D

## Productive capacity

# Market- based policies

- **Market-based supply side policies** are geared towards a free-market economy and promotes competition between firms; this improves efficiency and increases LRAS and potential output.

## Encouraging competition

- Governments may use market-based policies to encourage competition as it leads to greater efficiency, thereby increasing LRAS and achieving economic growth

### Deregulation

- **Deregulation** - reduction or elimination of regulations to lower costs of production for firms, which encourages competition
- Consumers may benefit from greater variety of choices, and firm would likely improve the quality of their products and / or lower their prices in order to attract customers
- However, deregulation does not guarantee more competition or efficiency as it can be difficult to create meaningful competition in an industry dominated by a natural monopoly owning to extreme barriers to entry.

### Privatization

- **Privatization -** process in which state-owned enterprises or assets are transferred from the public sectors to the private sector
- The market-based policy serves to increase competition and efficiency as firms in the private sector face greater competition and have a greater incentives to make profits.
    - As a result, private firms would likely be more efficient, as it must find ways to remain competitive and profitable to stay in the market

### Trade liberalization

- **Trade liberalization -** elimination of international trade barriers
- This encourages free trade, which increases competition and leads to greater efficiency. Producers can specialize according to their comparative advantages and trade with one another, which leads to a better allocation of the world’s resources

### Anti-monopoly regulation

- **Anti-monopoly regulation -** policies that are aimed at limiting the market power of dominant firms in an industry
- Without regulations, monopolies may abuse their market power
- Monopolies have no incentives to increase efficiency or to innovate, which leads to market failure.
- By using this market-based policy, governments can promote market competition which improves efficiency in the economy

## Labour market flexibility

- Governments may use market-based policies to increase labour market flexibility as it reduces labour costs and unemployment, thereby increasing LRAS and achieving economic growth

### Reducing the power of labour unions

- Labour unions/ trade unions - organizations which protect workers by using collective bargaining to negotiate higher wages and / or better conditions.
- Unions cause labour costs to increase
- Unemployment may rise as the quantity demanded falls
- Therefore, governments may use market-based policies to reduce the power of labour unions, which lowers labour costs closer to the competitive market equilibrium price
- By doing so, efficiency will increase, unemployment will fall, and the market will become more competitive

### Reducing unemployment benefits

- **Unemployment benefits -** transfer payments made by the government to support those who are unable to find employment. However, unemployment benefits may act as a disincentive for some people to find work
- reducing unemployment benefits will incentivize people to look for work.
- This will lower unemployment, increase efficiency in labour markets, and shift LRAS outwards.

### Abolishing minimum wages

- **Minimum wage -** lowest level of pay which can legally be paid to a worker

## Incentives

- Governments may use market-based policies to increase incentives or people to work and businesses to invest, thereby increasing LRAS and achieving growth

### Personal income tax cuts

- **Personal income tax -** levied on an individual’s wages, salaries, profits, and / or other forms of earnings
- Reduction in personal income tax will increase disposable income. This improves productivity by incentiviing individuals to work more or retiring at a later age. The market-based policy also incentivizes those currently without work to seek employment, thus reducing unemployment.
- Therefore, reducing personal income tax increases LRAS and the productive capacity

### Business tax cuts

- A business tax is levied on a corporation’s profits
- Reduction will increase the level of after-tax profits, which incentivizes producers to reinvest. This may result in greater capital accumulation and productive capacity in the economy, thereby increasing potential output.

### capital gains tax cuts

- **Capital gains tax (CGT)** - levied on corporatinos for the profits earned from the sale of assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate
- Reduction will

# Interventionist policies

- **Interventionist supply-side policies -** government intervention in the economy to increase LRAS and potential output.

## Education and training

- **Education and training -** improves human capital. Better education and training leads to more skilled, efficiency, and productivity; this increases the productive capacity of the economy and LRAs shifts outwards.

## Access to health care

- improving health of a population increases quality of human capital; this will increase the productivity of the workforce and shift LRAS outwards.

## Research and development

- **Research and development (R&D)** refers to business activities to introduce and innovate new products and process.
- R&D improves quality, quantity and/or capital resources which increases the productive capacity of the economy and shifts LRAS outwards.

## Provision of infrastructure

- **Infrastructure -** physical capital such as transportation systems, sewer systems, communication networks etc.
- Investments in infrastructure may lower costs, improve efficiency and productivity; this increases the productive capacity of the economy and LRAS shifts outwards
- For example, building a bridge can:
    - reduction in unemployment
    - Increase in productivity

## Industrial policies

- **Industrial policies -** Government policies which target specific industries to promote growth in key areas of the economy.
- Some of the ways in which government may support  industries:
    - Tax cuts
    - tax allowances
    - subsidized lending
    - trade protectionist policies

# Demand-side effects of supply-side policies

- Supply-side policies are capable of influencing **aggregate demand** in the economy.
- Interventionist policies such as investments on education, training, health care, R^D, and infrastructure all contribute to the **G component** of AD. [C + I + G (X-M)]

![Untitled](3%207%20Supply-side%20Policies%2022ad01cfc535408090bed91a317f3136/Untitled%203.png)

- Market-based policies such as reduction in personal income tax, business tax, and capital gains tax will influence the C and I component of AD

# Supply-side effects of fiscal policies

- While fiscal policies are demand-side policies, it is important to note that they are also capable of influencing **aggregate supply** in the economy
    - Fiscal policies involve the use of government spending and taxation to influence AD
- Government spending on education, training, health care, R&D, and  influence may improve the quality and/or quantity of resources.

# Effectiveness of Supply-Side Policies

## Constraints on supply-side policies - market based

### Equity issues

- Supply-side policies may have negative
- For example, labour market reforms will most likely hurt low-income earners or those relying on unemployment benefits and a greater extant than those earining higher incomes. High income earners are more lkely to benefit.

### Time lags

- Market-based policies take
- Market based policies takes a long time to take effect.
- drafting - presenting - voting - signing

### Vested interests

- **vested interest** - individuals or group of individuals who have a personal interest in becoming involved in certain policies or decisions
- For example, anti-monopoly regulations for companies involved in the antitrust law.

### Environmental impact

- Market-based policies such as deregulation may have detrimental effects on the environment

## Constraints on Supply-Side Policies - Interventionist

### Costs

- Interventionist supply-side policies can be exteremly costly for the government and may lead to a budget deficit.
- There is also an opportunity cost incurred when the government spends money on improving the supply side of the economy

### Time lags

- Like market-based policies.
- For examples, it may take decades for investments on education to affect the potential output of an economy

## Strengths of Supply-Side Policies - market based

### Improved resource allocation

- Market-based policies can help to improve the allocation of resources by improving allocative efficiency and productive efficiency
- For example:
    - Competition will pressure firms to lower their costs and improve efficiency
    - Labour market reforms will reduce structural and frictional unemployment.
    - Incentive-related policies will improve productivity and efficiency

### No burden on government budget

- Unlike interventionist policies, market-based policies are aimed at increasing free-market efficiency and hence the government does not incur any explicit costs

## Strengths of Supply-Side Policies - Interventionist

### Direct support of sectors important for growth

- Interventionist policies allow government to support specific sectors of the economy which are deemed important for growth.

## Effectiveness of Supply-Side policies

- In the short run, supply side policies can increase the level of AD in an economy
- In the long run, it can increase the productive capacity, which will shift LRAS leading to economic growth.
- Supply-side policies also enable economies to grow while achieving a low and stable rate of inflation.
