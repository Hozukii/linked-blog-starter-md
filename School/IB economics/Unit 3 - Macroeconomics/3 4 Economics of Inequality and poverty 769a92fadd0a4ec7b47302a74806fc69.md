# 3.4 Economics of Inequality and poverty

## Equity and Equality

- **Equity -** the fairness in the distribution of income, based on qualities, skills, experiences, and other factors
- **Equality -** the equal distribution of income, which is to reduce or eliminate income gaps

# What causes economic inequalities?

## Economic inequality

- Economic inequalities exists in different parts of the world

---

1. Different investments in healthcare and education around the world
2. Different level of skills development of people 
3. People own different levels of factors of production
4. Unequal income and wealth distribution

## Wealth vs Income

- Wealth refers to the accumulation of assets that have a monetary value, including savings, land, buildings.
- Income refers to the money households receive from factors of production

### Unequal distribution of income

- When there is an unequal distribution of income, only a small percentage of people account for a high concentration of national income, while a large percentage of the population account for a low portion of national income.
- There could be differences between occupations, regions of a country, skills, experiences etc.
- Income inequalities can exist between countries to amongst households.

### Unequal distribution of wealth

- People with higher incomes are more likely to accumulate a greater level of wealth.
- Higher level of wealth also result in larger income streams from assets.
- Low-income households are more likely to incur debts, which reduces their disposable income.

## Factors resulting in wealth inequalities between countries

- **High international debts and loans**  - Although some countries have a high debt to GDP ratio, they also have a high wealth per person ratio.
- **Natural resources** - Countries with rich natural resources can trade with other countries to garner wealth.
- **Environmental factors** - Countries facing environmental issues like floods and droughts are less prosperous, since these factors decrease their resource productivity and discourage investments.
- **Physical factors** - Countries facing hostile landscape challenges are less able to achieve wealth.
    - This includes hot and dry climates or conditions that are not suitable for farming
- **Social factors** - Countries with lower levels of education, population density, female participation in the workforce, and equality of healthcare tend to have lower levels of wealth
- **Political factors** - Political instability caused by wars or corruption may limit the country’s trading and economic activity, lowering the level of wealth

## Measuring economic inequality

- The extent of economic inequality can be measured by the share of national income within a certain percentage of the population
- The share of national income can be split into **deciles** (10% of the population) or **quintiles** (20% of the population) for comparison

### Plotting the Lorenz curve

**Lorenz curve** - Graphical representation of the income distrubition of an economy

1. Create a table to show the **cumulative percentage of population** and **cumulative percentage of income.** 
    
    ![Untitled](Vault/School/IB%20economics/Unit%203%20-%20Macroeconomics/3%204%20Economics%20of%20Inequality%20and%20poverty%20769a92fadd0a4ec7b47302a74806fc69/Untitled%201.png)
    
2. Insert cumulative percentage of population in the case of **absolute equality**

3. plot the data points
    1. x-axis as the cumulative percentage of population
    2. y-axis as the cumulative percentage of income
    3. select option “scatter with smooth lines and markers”

- **Line of perfect equality -** The line when income is equality distributed in an economy.
    - meaning the lowest 20% earn 20% of the income; the lowest 40% earn 40% and so on

### Gini coefficient

- **Gini coefficient** - measures income inequality by calculating a value from the Lorenz curve.
- The value ranges from 0-1

$$
\text{Gini Coefficient} = \dfrac{\text{Area B}}{\text{Area A + B}}
$$

# Poverty

- **Poverty -** when people do not have the minimum income required to afford basic human needs such as food, shelter, and clothing.

---

- **Absolute poverty -** the situation where people cannot access necessities for survival
- **Relative poverty -** Compares an individual’s income with the median income within the economy.
    - The relative poverty line is generally considered as below 50% of the economy’s median income

## Negative consequences of poverty

- **Low living standards** - those in poverty are less able to secure basic needs
- **Lack of access to healthcare and education** - This lowers the quality of human capital in the country, hindering economic growth and development
- **Conflict and war** - poverty tends to result in political instability or even civil war in extreme cases
- Lowering the ability of governments to achieve other macroeconomic objectives

# Measuring poverty

## Single indicators

### International poverty lines

- The international poverty lines refer to the minimum level of income an individuals must earn to afford basic needs.
- The world bank defines the line at 2.15USD / day
- The cost of living differs across countries, so when determining the international poverty line, the World Bank uses purchasing power parity exchange rates to ensure that price of goods and services are standardized.

### Minimum income standards (MIS)

- This is a research method that determines the minimum amount of income needed for what the public believes is an acceptable living standard measured via a basket of goods and services.
- This measures the number of people living below the income threshold.
- In the UK, the MIS is used to calculate:
    - living wage
    - reference point for the government for helping people in need.
    - Cost of bearing and raising a child

## Composite indicators

### Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI)

- This is a composite measure of poverty that measures different deficiencies of individuals in terms of their:
    - health
    - education
    - standards of living

## Difficulties in measuring poverty

Some challenges include:

- The subjectivity of relative poverty
- Discrepancies in how the national poverty of poor countries translate to the international poverty line
- Problems of the “low income” benchmark. A permanently low income is different from a temporarily low income resulting from recession. Income should not be the sole factor for measuring poverty
- PPP values differ based on locations and time. It makes it more difficult to measure absolute and relative poverty against the international poverty.

# Causes of economic inequality and poverty

### Inequality of opportunity

- Some individuals have less access to employment and consumption opportunities.
    - For example, people in cities tend to have better access to education, better healthcare and employment .

### Different levels of resource ownership

- Most households provide labour for wages while smaller portion has businesses, land, and capital which generates multiple income streams

### Different levels of human capital

- Human capital - skills, health, knowledge, and experiences that an individuals possess

### Discrimination

- Discrimination to certain social groups
- Ethnic minorities and woman have historically experienced discrimination in the labour market.
- This may lead to difficulty finding employment or receiving lower wages for the same work.

### Unequal status and power

- Higher income individuals may enjoy higher social status. They may use positions of power to influence government policies to favour their own interest.

### Government tax and benefit policies

- Taxation and welfare benefits can redistribute income to help lower income households.

### Globalization and technological change

- The economic and social benefits of globalization are not distributed equally across the globe.
- **Market instability -** caused when local firms cannot compete with large multinational corporations, creating inequality and poverty in low-income countries
- **Trade liberalization policies** have increased wage gaps between the educated and uneducated, and the skilled and unskilled
- Technological changes have also caused a greater inequality and poverty

### Market-based supply-side policies

- Market-based supply-side policies focuses on market forces to create incentives to work and invest, increasing the productive capacity of the economy.
- Examples:
    - Deregulation
    - Privatization
    - Trade-liberalization
    - Anti-monopoly regulation
- While these policies benefit firms, they often lead to greater levels of unemployment and lower incomes for workers, increasing inequality and poverty.

# Impacts of income and wealth inequality on economic growth

- Greater wealth inequality may also be detrimental to the economy.
- Social tension can lead to lower investment and productivity (e.g. protest.
- Higher government spending on transfer payment such as unemployment benefits
- Workers discouraged from labour force if there are attractive welfare systems
- Demotivation for entrepreneurs of small businesses to invest due to the inability to compete.

## The role of taxation in reducing economic inequality

Taxation can be used to redistribute income:

- Tax revenues used to directly provide or subsidize merit goods
- Provision of infrastructure
- Transfer payments to reduce income inequalities

## Different tax systems

1. Progressive
2. Proportional
3. Regressive

### Progressive tax

- **Progressive tax** - as incomes rise, the average rate of tax increases, and vice versa.
    - The more progressive the tax system, the more effective in reducing income inequality.

### Proportional tax (flat rate tax)

- **Proportional tax -** tax rate is fixed for all income earner.
- Examples include:
    - capital gains tax,
    - value added tax (VAT)
    - goods and services tax (GST)

### Regressive tax

- **Regressive tax -** as income rise, the average tax rate falls, vice versa
- Indirect tax is **regressive** in nature.
    - As the fixed amount of money is a smaller rate compared to their income for higher income households.
    - and higher rate compared to their income for lower income households.

## Average marginal tax rate

- **Average tax rate -** the total mount of tax paid as a percentage of income

$\text{average tax rate} = \frac {\text{Total tax paid}}{\text{Total income}}$

- **Marginal tax rate -** change in tax rate on a change in income

$\text{marginal tax rate} = \frac {\text{change in tax paid}}{\text{change in income }}$

## Direct taxes

- **Direct taxes** - imposed on individual and business income rather than on expenditure.
- In general, there are three types of direct taxes:
    - Personal income taxes
    - Corporate income taxes
    - Wealth taxes

### Personal income taxes

- Most countries with high personal income taxes are economically developed countries.
- The government make use of the tax revenue for the provision of public and merit goods.
- Personal income taxes that are too high might discouraged the unemployed to join the workforce, as the opportunity cost of working increases.
- To evade tax liabilities, more illegal transactions may take place

### Corporate income taxes

- **Corporate income tax** - type of direct tax imposed on the annual profits received by firms
- Firms may argue for lower taxes to improve profitability and increase investment in the long term
- Higher tax rates make income redistribution more effective
- Overtaxing leads to disincentives and tax avoidance problems

### Wealth taxes

- **Wealth tax**  - imposed on the market value of assets owned by individuals or firms
- It can be imposed on second homes that are not owner-occupied , inheritance, pension plans, and investment funds, which helps to minimize the income gap.

### Indirect taxes

- **Indirect tax -** imposed on expensive goods and services can be used to reduce economic inequality.
- For example, on sale of commercial or residential properties.
- As wealthier people have higher consumption expenditure, they tend to pay greater values of indirect tax.

## Other policies to reduce poverty, income and wealth inequality

- Policies to reduce inequalities of opportunities
- Investment in human capital
- Transfer payments
- Targeted spending on goods and services
- Universal basic income (UBI)
- Policies to reduce discrimination
- Minimum wages

### Policies to reduce inequalities of opportunities / investment in human capital

- Increasing minimum wage to raise incomes of low-waged workers
- Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) scheme provides tax benefits for people with low income with children.
- Investment in early education to increase labour productivity and mobility
- More progressive taxes to increase government revenue and reduce income inequality
- Encourage housing or low-income households, to lower social segregation by income

### Transfer payments

- **Transfer payments** are financial aids given by the government to vulnerable individuals.
- Drawbacks of transfer payments:
    - Opportunity cost of government expenditure
    - Potentially discourages workers due increased opportunity costs
- Examples:
    - Unemployment benefits
    - Subsidies
    - Disability allowances
    - student loans
    - Pension payments

### Targeted spending on goods and services

- Government spending on merit and public goods and services will allow lower income individuals greater access to satisfy their needs and wants
- **Conditional cash transfer programmes** (CCT) is also common

### Universal basic income (UBI)

- **Universal basic income -** concept where government provides a set amount of money to the residents of a country on a regular basis, regardless of any other income

### Policies to reduce discrimination

- Anti-discrimination laws are essential in reducing and preventing discrimination in the place

### Minimum wage

- **Minimum wage -** lowest wage level an employer is required to pay workers during a time period.
- It may encourage higher labour participation or allow the government to redistribute its resources for achieving other resources.
- There is also a greater transparency in the labour market
