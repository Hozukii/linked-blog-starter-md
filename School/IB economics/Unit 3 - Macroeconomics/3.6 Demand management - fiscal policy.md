- **Fiscal policy -** involves the use of government spending and taxation to fulfil macroeconomic objectives by influencing AD. There are two types:
    - Expansionary fiscal policy
    - Contractionary fiscal policy
# Fiscal Policy Tools
- **Fiscal policy** can be used to promote long-term economic growth and reduce unemployment by:
    - Government spending on physical capital goods
    - Government spending on human capital formation
    - Provision of incentives for firms to invest
# Fiscal Policy Objectives
- Fiscal policy has six main objectives:
    - Low unemployment
    - Promoting a stable economic environment for long-term growth
    - Low and stable inflation
    - Reducing business cycle fluctuations
    - Achieving an equitable distribution of income
    - Trade balance.
## Taxation
- **Direct taxes** are imposed on **income (rent, wages, interest rate, profit)**
    - Income tax
    - Corporation tax
    - Capital gains tax
- **Indirect taxes** are imposed on **expenditure**
    - Sales tax
    - Excise tax
## Alternative Sources of Government Revenue
- State-owned enterprises earn revenue through the sale of goods and services
- Governments can sell state-owned enterprises to the private sector i.e. **privatization**
## Revenues and expenditures
- **Expenditure -** money spent by governments, either through government spending or transfer payments
    - **transfer payments** - payments made by the government without goods or services being received in return
- Government spending can be split into two types
    - **Current expenditure ( short-term)**
        - Wages for public sector employees
        - Supplies for public sector businesses
        - Interest payments for national debt
        - The provision of subsidies and grants
    - **Capital expenditures ( long-term)**
        - Infrastructure
- Government budget can be of three types:
    - **Balanced:** expenditures = revenues
    - **Surplus:**  expenditures < revenues
    - **Deficit:** expenditures > revenues
## Expansionary Fiscal Policy

![[expansionary fiscal policy.png|400]]
- Particularly important in Keynesian economics as economies may be stuck in a recessionary gap for long periods of time
- Any government spending which improves the **quantity or quality of resources** will improve AD and AS
- Examples:
    - GS on R&D and physical capital goods
    - GS on human capital development
    - Provision of incentives for firms to invest through lower business taxes
- As a result, productive capacity of economy increases, shifting AS curve outwards

## Contractionary Fiscal Policy

- **Contractionary fiscal policy** aims to reduce AD by
    - Decreasing government expenditure
    - Increasing direct and indirect taxes
- This can slow economic grow to a healthy level to prevent the economy from overheating. High levels of economic growth can cause:
    - Undesirably high levels of inflation
    - Shortage in the labour markets

# Evaluation of Fiscal Policy
##### The strengths of fiscal policy include:
- Ability to target specific economic sectors
- Stimulates recovery from a deep recession
##### Limitations:
- Political pressures
- Time lags
- Sustainable debt
- Crowding out (HL only )
## Targeting of Specific Economic Sectors
- Fiscal policy can be used to correct regional disparities in income and spending habits
- Similarly, government spending can be targeted at he unemployed, retirees, those with disabilities or those with young children.
## Recovering from a Deep Recession
- Government spending provides a direct injection of money into the circular flow of income
- Furthermore, Keynesian multiplier, the change in national output is greater than the initial injection
- Expansionary fiscal policy can also holp increase confidence levels during a recession.
## Political Pressure
- Political constraints and political pressures mean that government spending and taxation policy decisions are often influenced by political rather than economic factors
- Political pressures prevent the use of contractionary fiscal policy such as higher taxes and less government spending as this may be politically unfavourable.
## Time lags
- There are 3 types of time lags
    - Recognition lag
    - Administrative lag
    - Effectiveness lag
### Recognition lag
- It takes time to tell whether an economy is in need for government intervention.
- Furthermore, supply-side shocks can happen at any time, so it is difficult to plan and budget for shocks such as natural disasters and pandemics
### Administrative lag
- it will take time to implement fiscal policy
    - Approval for tax changes
    - changes to the government budget
### Effectiveness lag
- Time lag between the implementation of fiscal policies to seeing the actual effects to take place
    - Small reduction in income tax will take  time to have significant impact
    - The construction of a new school will take many years before graduates to enter the labour force
