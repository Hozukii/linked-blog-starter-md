# National income
- National income accounting - used to measure a nation’s level of economic activity
- There are three equivalent measurements of economic activity expressed in monetary terms:
    - Total expenditure
    - Total income
    - Total output of goods and services
# Circular flow of income
- **Circular flow of income** - shows the flow of money between different stakeholders of an economy and is also used to illustrate three methods of national income
![[circular flow of income.png|400]]
### Expenditure approach
- Measures the value of total expenditure by all stakeholders in the economy is expressed as:
- GDP = C + I + G + (X-M),
- G = government spending
- I = investments
- C = Consumer expenditures
- X = export
- M = imports
- The total expenditure from consumers, the government , the financial sector, and foreign economics goes towards domestic firms
### Income approach
- Measures the value of all factors inocome earned in the economy
- GDP = interest + profits + rent + wages
- the money domestic firms receive from total expenditure is transferred to households as **factor incomes** in exchange for factors of production
### Output approach
- Measures the value of all final goods and services produced in a country
- Total value of output of goods and services is equal to the factor incomes used to purchase the factors of production, which is equal to the total expenditures of al stakeholders.
## Leakages and injections
- An **injection** refer to the additional money added into the closed circular flow of income
- A **leakage** refers to a withdrawal of money from the closed circular flow of income
- If injections > leakages in the circular flow, national income increases
- Leakages > injections in the circular flow, national income decreases.
# Nominal Gross domestic product
- **Nominal GDP -** measures the value of all final goods and services produced in an economy with in a given time period, using *current price levels.*
- Meaning that nominal GDP is not adjusted for changes in price levels over time (non-inflation adjusted)
- GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government spending + (exports - imports)  = C + I + G + (X-M)
# Nominal Gross national income (GNI)
- **Gross national income(GNI) -** Measures the value of all income earned by the country’s citizens *including income earned from abroad*
- GNI = GDP + **Net income from abroad**
- Net income from broad / income from abroad - income sent abroad
# Real GD> vs real GNI
### Real vs nominal
- real GDP and real GNI are measures of economic activity which are calculated using **constant prices,** meaning the values are adjusted for changes in price levels over time
- Nominal GDP and nominal DNI are measured using **current prices,** thus these values are not adjusted for changes in price levels over time
- An increase in nominal GDP may suggest that output has increased over time, when the rise in nominal GDP may actually be due to inflation.
- Therefore, real GDP and real GNI are more accurate measures of comparing economic activity
### Calculation
- Real GDP and real GNI values are calculated using a price deflator
$$\space \space \text{Real GDP} = \dfrac{\text{nominal GDP}}{\text{GDP deflator}} \cdot 100$$
- The base deflator is always equal to 100
## Real GDP/ GNI per capita
### Total vs per capita
- Real GDP and real GNI values indicate the overall size of the economy. On the other hand, **per capita** values indicate the average income per person thus providing a better indication of living standard
## Purchasing power parity (PPP)
- **Purchasing power** - the amount of goods and services that can be bought with one unit of a currency
- **Purchasing power parity (PPP) -** the exchange rate needed to buy the same basket of goods and services in different countries using the same amount of money.
- Metric allows for more accurate comparisons between the value of output produced in different countries
# Business cycle
- illustrates short-term fluctuations of real GDP over time
- It consists of the following phases:
    - Expansion
    - Peak
    - Recession
    - Trough
The long term growth trend in the business cycle illustrates the **potential GDP** of an economy
- An **expansion** occurs when real GDP increases over time.
- A **peak** is the highest point of a business cycle.
- A **recession** occurs when real GDP decreases over time.
- A **trough** is the lowest point of a business cycle.
## output and unemployment
- An economy achieves **full employment** when real GDP = potential GDP
- Here, unemployment = the natural rate of unemployment.
- An economy experiences an inflationary gap when:
    - real GDP > potential GDP.
    - Here, unemployment < the natural rate of unemployment
- An economy experiences an **deflationary gap** when:
    - real GDP < potential GDP
    - Here, unemployment > the natural rate of unemployment

# Using GDP / GNI to measure economic well-being
- A higher GDP / GNI  per capita value usually corresponds to a higher **standard of living,** as the average person will be able to purchase more goods and services.
### Distribution of income
- GDP and GNI does not account for the distribution of income and wealth in the country.
### Cost of living
- Differences in the cost of living are ignored.
- For example, Hong Kong has the highest real estate price s in the world, with average property price exceeding the average annual salary by 22 times.
### Negative externalities
- GDP and GNI statistics do not account of the **negative externalities** which arise with increased production in the economy.
- As a result, ecomomic well being may be overstated as environmental costs are not considered.
### Green GDP
- **Green GDP -** measure of economic activity which accounts for environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources
- Green GDP = GDP - environmental costs of production
### Informal activities
- GDP and GNI statistics may be **understated** as they do not account for informal activities involving **non-marketed goods** and those in the **hidden/ underground economy**
## Alternative measures of well-being
- OECD Better Life index (BLI)
- Happiness index
- happy planet index (HPI)
- Human development index (HDI)
