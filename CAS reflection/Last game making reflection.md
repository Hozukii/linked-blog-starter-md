We never got to finish the game as we became busy with internal assessments and other things concerning the IB. However, I am glad that I was able to have this experience. This was the first time that I had experienced making any kind of game and also pixel art. I realized that it's hard to keep a passion project when other things are happening in life. I wish that we did finish the game and we might finish it after the IB is done just so we can be satisfied with it. The hardest thing with it was to communicate with everybody since if there is one part of the project is stagnant then the project can't go on. I was part of the bottleneck as I didn't prioritize this project enough to start working on my 3rd scene. Honestly I didn't want to start because the project was massive.  Overall, it was a fun experience being able to draw and work with friends.
