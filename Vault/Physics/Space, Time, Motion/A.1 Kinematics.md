Kinematics The study of moving objects
In diagrams, all vectors are shown with straight arrows, pointing in a certain direction from the correct point of application
# Distance and Displacement 
- **Distance** - total length travelled, without consideration of directions
- **Displacement** - Distance in a straight line from an fixed reference point in a specified direction

# Speed and Velocity 

## Speed
- Speed is a *[[scalar]]* quantity
- Average Speed = $\frac{ \text{distance travelled}}{ \text {time taken}}$ 
- Instantaneous speed is determined over a very short time interval, during which it is assumed that the speed does not change
- **Speed is given in the same symbol, v , as velocity**

>[!tip] tool
>When measuring time, there is going to be a uncertainty caused by **reaction time** and **Human error**. Electronics sensers, such as **Light gates** are very useful in obtaining a accurate time measurement

## velocity
**Velocity, (v)** - rate of change in position. Speed with a direction
$v = \dfrac{displacement}{\text{time taken}} = \dfrac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ = si unit $ms^{-1}$
As they are often confused, it might be a good idea to define these two quantities in words, rather than symbols.
- A [[vector quantity]]

# Acceleration
- Any variation from moving at a constant speed in a straight line is descirbed as an acceleartion
- Acceleration, a, is defined as: $\dfrac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{Change in time}}$ $$a = \dfrac{\Delta v}{t} si \space unit \space ms^{-2}$$
- Negative acceleration is still acceleration

# Displacement-time graphs and Distance-time Graphs

## Distance-time graphs
![[Pasted image 20231007220224.png]]
- A curve line represents a changing velocity, acceleration
- In physics, Displacement-time graphs are more common than distance-time graphs for example: for a ball throw vertically:

### Gradients of displacement-time graphs
- The **gradient** of the graph is $\dfrac{\Delta s}{t}$ , which is the velocity of the object
### Gradient of Velocity time graphs
- The gradient of the graph $\dfrac{\Delta v}{t}$, which is the acceleration of the object
- The graph acceleration of an object is equal to the gradient of the velocity-time graph
## Areas under Velocity- time and Speed-time graphs
- The area under a velocity time graph is always equal to the change of displacement 
- The area under a speed-time graph is always equal to the distance travelled
## Acceleration-time graphs
- Mostly concerned with constant acceleration

### Areas under acceleration-time graphs
$a = \dfrac{\Delta v}{t}$
- The area under an acceleration-time graph is equal to the change in velocity

# Equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion (Suvat)
>[!info] variables
>s = displacement
u = initial velocity 
v = final velocity
a = acceleration
t = time

>[!important] equations
>$s = \dfrac {u + v}{t} \cdot t$
$v = u + at$
$s = ut+ \dfrac12 at^2$
$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$

# Projectile motion
**Projectile** - An object that has been projected through air in which then moves only under the action of the forces of gravity and air resistance
## Components of a Projectile's velocity 
- Instantaneous velocity can be resolved into $v_v$ and $v_h$ 
 ![[Pasted image 20231008094426.png | 300]]
- If there is no air resistance, the horizontal component of a projectile's velocity will remain constant(Until it comes into contact with something else)
- **Trajectory** - The path followed by a projectile
- **Parabolic** - Typical shape of a freely moving projectile 
- **Range** - the horizontal distance covered 
## Fluid Resistance and Terminal Speed 
- As any object moves through air, the air is forced to move out of the path of the object. This causes drag
- **Drag** - Opposing motion through a fluid(also called fluid resistance)
- **Fluid** - Liquid or gas
- Objects falling through fluids have a **Constant maximum velocity**, called **Terminal velocity**, Which occurs when their acceleration has reduced to zero because of increasing fluid resistance

### Effect of Air Resistance on the Trajectory of a Projectile 
- With resistance, the horizontal component of a projectile's velocity will no longer be constant but it decreases
- Vertical motion without air resistance downwards is $9.8ms^{-1}$ but air resistance will reduce the acceleration. 
- Air resistance reduces the range of a projectile and its trajectory will not be **parabolic**
