- **work** and **energy** together provide the "accounting system" for science, enabling explanations and useful predictions to be made. 
# Work 
- **Work, W,** - The energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved with a force. 
- Work done = force x displacement in the direction of the force
## Work done by constant forces
- Work is done whhen any force moves an object.

> Si unit: Joule, J, $kg m^2 s^{-2}$ which is also Nm


- 1 **Joule** is defined to be the work done when a force of 1N moves through a distance of 1m
## Work done by varying forces
- We have to make an estimate of the *average* force
- Then, Work done = $F_avg \cdot s$
- Work done is equal to the area under a force-distance graph
# Energy
