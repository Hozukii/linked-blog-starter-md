- **work** and **energy** together provide the "accounting system" for science, enabling explanations and useful predictions to be made. 
# Work 
- **Work, W,** - The energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved with a force. 
- Work done = force x displacement in the direction of the force
## Work done by constant forces
- Work is done whhen any force moves an object. 
> [!info] Work done
> $W = Fs cos \theta$ 
> Si unit: Joule, J, $kg m^2 s^{-2}$ which is also Nm


- 1 **Joule** is defined to be the work done when a force of 1N moves through a distance of 1m
## Work done by varying forces
- We have to make an estimate of the *average* force
- Then, Work done = $F_avg \cdot s$
- Work done is equal to the area under a force-distance graph
# Energy
- When work is done energy is transferred from a source to the object
- **Energy** ability to do work
## Different forms of energy
- There are many types of **Potential energy**
- **Potential energy** - store energy because of their position or arrangement, and the forces between different ports of the system
- **Gravitational potential energy** - The energy stored due to the position of a mass in a gravitational field
- **Electrical potential energy** - Energy stored due to position of a charge in an electron. 
- **Magnetic potential energy** - Energy stored in a deformed elastic material, or a spring. 
- **Chemical potential energy** - Energy stored in the bonding of chemical compounds, released in chemical reactions
- **Nuclear potential energy** - The energy stored in the arrangement of particles in the nuclei of atoms
---
**Mechanical Energy** - A macroscopic object that is able to do work. 
Mechanical energy can come in one of three forms:
- **Kinetic energy** - The energy of all moving masses whhich could do work on anything they collide with. 
- Elastic potential energy
- Gravitational potential energy
All matter contains large amounts of energy inside it. 
**Internal energy** - enormous amount of energy which exists within matter because of their motions and positions of the particles it contains.

## Energy Transfers
Total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant because of [[The Conservation of Energy]]
