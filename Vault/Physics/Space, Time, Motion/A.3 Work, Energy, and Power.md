- **work** and **energy** together provide the "accounting system" for science, enabling explanations and useful predictions to be made. 
# Work 
- **Work, W,** - The energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved with a force. 
- Work done = force x displacement in the direction of the force
## Work done by constant forces
- Work is done whhen any force moves an object.
