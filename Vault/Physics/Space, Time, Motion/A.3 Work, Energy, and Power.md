- **work** and **energy** together provide the "accounting system" for science, enabling explanations and useful predictions to be made. 
# Work 
- **Work, W,** - The energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved with a force. 
- Work done = force x displacement in the direction of the force
## Work done by constant forces
- Work is done whhen any force moves an object. 
> [!info] Work done
> $W = Fs cos \theta$ 
> Si unit: Joule, J, $kg m^2 s^{-2}$ which is also Nm


- 1 **Joule** is defined to be the work done when a force of 1N moves through a distance of 1m
## Work done by varying forces
- We have to make an estimate of the *average* force
- Then, Work done = $F_avg \cdot s$
- Work done is equal to the area under a force-distance graph
# Energy
- When work is done energy is transferred from a source to the object
- **Energy** ability to do work
## Different forms of energy
- There are many types of **Potential energy**
- **Potential energy** - store energy because of their position or arrangement, and the forces between different ports of the system
- **Gravitational potential energy** - The energy stored due to the position of a mass in a gravitational field
- **Electrical potential energy** - Energy stored due to position of a charge in an electron. 
- **Magnetic potential energy** - Energy stored in a deformed elastic material, or a spring. 
- **Chemical potential energy** - Energy stored in the bonding of chemical compounds, released in chemical reactions
- **Nuclear potential energy** - The energy stored in the arrangement of particles in the nuclei of atoms
---
**Mechanical Energy** - A macroscopic object that is able to do work. 
Mechanical energy can come in one of three forms:
- **Kinetic energy** - The energy of all moving masses whhich could do work on anything they collide with. 
- Elastic potential energy
- Gravitational potential energy
All matter contains large amounts of energy inside it. 
**Internal energy** - enormous amount of energy which exists within matter because of their motions and positions of the particles it contains.  
###### Topics Covered in later chapters
- Thermal energy
- Electrical energy
- Radiation energy 
## Energy Transfers
Total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant because of [[The Conservation of Energy]] 
#### Dissipation of energy 
- Enengy that has spread into the surroundings and cannot be recovered to do useful work. 
- All macroscopic processes dissipate energy into the surroundings. 
# Calculating Mechanical Energies 
Work can be done on a macroscopic object to give it kinetic, gravitational potential, or elastic potential energy. 
The symbol, $E$ can be used to represent energy(E is also used for electric field)
## Kinetic energy
>[!note] equation
>$E_k = \dfrac12$mv^2

- Since, momentum, $mv$, is given the symbol $p$, kinetic energy can also be determined from $E_k = \dfrac{p^2}{2m}$
- Objects which are vibrating or rotating also have kinetic energy, but we need different equations to calculate their values. Will be covered later
## Gravitational Potential Energy 
- The gravitational potential energy of a mass raised a heigh $\Delta h$, close to the Earth's surface can be calculated using $\Delta E_p = mg\Delta h$
- A mass resting on a table, or on the ground, does not have zero gravitational energy. Se when we use the equation, we are calculating how much more, or less, gravitational potential energy the object has. 
## Elastic Potential Energy
