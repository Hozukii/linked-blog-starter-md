- If you meet those who are meddling, ungrateful, aggressive, treacherous, malicous, unsocial: Do not let them infect you with their ideas and way of living. **However,** you cannot hate or be mad at them. Humans must work in cooperation. 
- Think about each hour of the day. Do not let any hour go to waste. Perform every task with precision, sympathy , and justice.
