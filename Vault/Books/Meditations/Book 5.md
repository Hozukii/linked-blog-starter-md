- At the start of the day, when you are resenting to get out of bed, think: I am getting up for a man's work. Men are not supposed to stay in their bed and be comfortable. Everyone is supposed to do what they need to. Bees create honey, Horses race. Can you not see all the other creatures and plants do the work? So why should you rest. 
- You have to be the one to do good. But in a sense, you should be unconscious of the good you do. It's just your human nature to be nice. The good should be genuine and you should not expect them to pay the good deed back. They do not owe you anything
- Luck is something you determine yourself. It comes with good actions, good impulses, and an good inclination of the [[inclination]] of the soul
