- People are unable to fathom the full consequences of their actions. 
- The Pursuit of an easier life has led to a harder working life in the agricultural age compared to the hunter gathering age.
- People work hard when they are students saying they will be able to retire early, while in reality they graduate work hard have kids and mortgages, work harder. But it is too late to turn back. 
- It was too late to turn back to the hunter gatherers age because no one remembered the life before. There was also an influx of population.
- In the context of population, chickens and cows are one of the most successful creatures but that is a judgement only on survival and reproduction with no regard for happiness or suffering. 
- Domestication of animals are founded on a series of brutal practices that became more brutal with the passing of centuries. 
- To turn animals obedient, their natural instincts and social ties had to be broken, their aggression and sexuality contained, and their freedom of movement curtailed such as locking animals in a fence, putting leashes and harnesses, using whips to train their behavior, etc. Reminds me of [[1984 George Orwell]]
- A Rhinoceros at the brink of extinction is more satisfied than a calf who spends a short life in a tiny box.
