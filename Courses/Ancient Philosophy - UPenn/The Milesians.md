# Studying the Pre-Socratics
## How We Study The Pre-Socratics
- The Pre-Socratic philosophers are:
	- Thales, 625BCE
	- Anaximander, 610 BCE
	- Anaximenes, 600BCE
	- Heraclitus, 540BCE
	- Parmenides, 515BCE
	- Anaxagoras, 500BCE
- The problem with studying the Pre-Socratics are that we don't have any of the books that they wrote
- We get our information about them from quotations from later philosophers
- From the fragment of the lost works, we have to figure out what the whole edifice looked like through interpretation, hypothesis, and conjecture
	- **edifice** - large building or a complex system of beliefs
## Fragments and Sources
- Pieces we are working with are excerpts from the texts of later writers which are collected together into sourcebooks
### Excerpts
- **excerpts** - a short part taken from a speech, book, film, etc...
- Categorized into fragments and testimonia:
	- Fragments - actual quotations 
	- Testimonia - paraphrases, summaries, reports, etc.
#### The Diels-Kranz System
- Testimonia marked **A**
- Fragments are marked **B**
- When talking looking at fragments or testimonia, we refer to them by their DK numbers
	- For example "Heraclitus B50"
- Each Pre-Socratic philosophers have a chapter in the Diels-Kranz. For example for thales:
	- DK 11A9
		- The 11 is the chapter that the testimonia comes in 
- we want to find out what it is about these thinkers that made Aristotle call "Those who first pursued philosophy(DK 11A12)
# Thales
- The first philosopher
- Thales is an astronomer
### science vs philosophy?
- Back then, astronomy was part of philosophy in Socrates' terms
- Milesians were engaged in many natural scientific discoveries
- Aristotle called philosopher in virtue of their inquires into nature a physiologoi(naturalists)
- That make the Milesians the first natural scientist in the western sense
# Material principle 
- The material that make every other object
- Thales thought that water was the material principle
- Anaximenes: Air
- Anaximander thought that the world was made from "apeiron"
	- Apeiron - unbounded, infinite 
- We can see the *shared outlook in Milesian Natural Philosophy*
	1. Seek to understand natural phenomena from the inside out
		- They seek to understand the world by appeal to the inner workings of nature, not divine intervention like many myths at the time.
