- $y'$ is increasing 
- $\therefore y''> 0$
- it is concave up
## maximum

- $y'$ is decreasing
- $\therefore y'' < 0$ 
- concave down

## Second derivative test
- Suppose $f''$ is defined on both sides of the stationary point x = a
- Then: 
	- if $f''(a) > 0 \implies$ f has a local **min** at x =a
	- If $f''(a) < 0 \implies$ f has a local **max** at x = a 
	- if $f''(a) = 0 \implies$ the test is inconclusive
- Second derivative test is mainly applicable to polynomials and exponential functions.
- does not always work:
	- for example: $x^4 = y$
	- although concave up, the second derivative test will say 0
