Let $f$ be a continous function on interval $[a,b]$ such that for $C \in [a,b]$ we have: 
### $$\lim_{h\to 0} \dfrac{f(x +h) - f(x)}{h} = f'(x) = \dfrac{dy}{dx}$$

it is to find the derivative from the first principle
## Laws of derivatives
- If a function has a derivative at $x = a$, we say it is *differentiable* at $x=a$
- if $f$ is a differentiable at $x = a  \implies \space f$ is continuous at $x = a$
- if $f$ is a continuous at $x = a \centernot\implies \space f$ is differentiable at $x =a$
