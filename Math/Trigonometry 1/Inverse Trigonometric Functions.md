# Definition, Graphs & Properties
- For a function to have a **inverse function**, it has to be *one to one*, meaning the graph needs to pass the *horizontal line test*
- Therefore, we need to restrict the domain. 
#### $y = arcsin(x)$  iff $sin(y) = x$ 
- Domain: $-1 \leq x \leq 1$
- Range: $-\dfrac {\pi}2 \leq y \leq \dfrac \pi2$
#### $y = arccos(x)$ iff $cos(y) = x$ 
- Domain: $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ 
- Range: $0 \leq y \leq \pi$
#### $y = arctan(x)$ iff $tan(y) = x$
- Domain: $-\infty < x < \infty$ 
- Range: $-\dfrac \pi 2 < y < \dfrac \pi 2$

The trigonometric functions have **angles as inputs** and *numbers as outputs*, whereas the inverse trigonometric functions have **numbers as inputs** and *angles as outputs*
