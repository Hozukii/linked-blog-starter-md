$cosine$ is an even function
$Sine$ is an odd function
$Tangent$ is an odd function. 
# Tangent
$f(x) = tan(x)$ is periodic and its period is $180\degree$
$Tan(x + y) = \dfrac{sin(x + y)}{cos(x+y)} = \dfrac{sin(x) \cdot cos(y) + sin(y)\cdot cos(x)}{cos(x) \cdot cos(y) - sin(y)\cdot sin(x)} = \dfrac{tan(x) + tan(y)}{1 - tan(x) \cdot tan(y)}$
