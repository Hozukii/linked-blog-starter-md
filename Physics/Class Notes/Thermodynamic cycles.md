- Work is force x distance
- So in a gas, what is the force
- Force when discussing an ideal gas is pressure (P) F/A
- So then $W = \dfrac{F}{A \cdot d}$
- d is the volume
- **Isobaric** - pressure is remaining constant
- The volume will change when force is applied because the gas will expand.
- Therefore $W = P\Delta V$ 
- $\Delta V$ - Change in volume
- **Isovolumetric** - constant volume
- **isothermal** - constant temperature
#### Adiabatic
- An adiabatic process in one in which no heat is transferred into or out of teh system
- Work done on or by the system changes its internal energy, which can lead to changes in temperature eventually
- In an adiabatic compression, the temperature rises
- adiabatic expansion - the temperature falls, without any heat being exchanged with the environment
