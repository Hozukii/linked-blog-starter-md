# What is climate
### Troposphere
- layer that touches earth
- The temperature decreases 6.5 K every kilometre you go up
- 0 to 12-17km
### Stratosphere
- Remains constant at 213.15K(-60C)
- The temperature of the upper stratosphere rises to +18K
- 17-50km
- features jet streams
	- horizontal movement of air-very strong winds
- Ozone layer - protective layer of earth -
	- holds in heat and protects from UV rays
### Mesosphere
- Temperature of the Mesosphere decreases to 173.15K(-100C)
- The coldest region of the atmosphere
- 50-80km
- Protects Earth from meteors via friction
### Thermosphere
- Temperature is +2273K(+2000K)
- Broken into two smaller segments
##### Ionosphere
- 80-550
- Ions are present
##### Exosphere
- 550-3200km
- Air so thin there is great visibility
- satellites orbit here
## Secondary energy source
- **Secondary energy source** - an energy source, such as electricity or hydrogen, which has been transformed from a primary energy source before use by the consumers
# Specific energy and energy density of fuel sources
- **Specific energy**$E_{sp}$  - how much energy (J ) you can get per unit mass(kg) from a fuel. $Jkg^{-1}$
- **Energy density** $E_{D}$ - is how much energy you can get per unit volume. $Jm^{-1}$
