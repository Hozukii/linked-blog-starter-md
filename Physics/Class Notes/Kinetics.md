Back to Boltzmann
$$\overline{E_k} = \dfrac 32 k_B T$$
- The equation represents the average kinetic energy of a particle in an ideal gas where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature in Kelvin
- Boltzmann constant is: 
	- $k_B = 1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} JK^{-1}$
	- in the data booklet
	- make sure its the Boltzmann constant not Stefan
