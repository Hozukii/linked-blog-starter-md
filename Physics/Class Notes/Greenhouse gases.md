### Albedo
- **Albedo** - When light strikes an object, some of it is absorbed, and some of it is scattered.
- We define **albedo** in terms of scattered and incident power
	- $albedo = \dfrac{P_{scattereded}}{P_{ncident}}$ 
- Landforms, vegetation, weather, and seasons affect a planet's albedo 
### Emissivity 
- $Emissivity = \dfrac{\text{power radiated per unit area}}{\sigma T^4}$

# Greenhouse gases part 2
- Gas that contributes the most to the greenhouse effect in our atmosphere in descending order :
	- Water vapour ($H_2O$ )
	- Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)
	- Nitrous oxide ($N_2O$)
	- Methane ($CH_4$)
	- ozone($O_3$)
## GWP(Global Warming potential)
- For human induced climate change, the gases all contain various potential. 
- **anthropogenic** - originating in human activity
