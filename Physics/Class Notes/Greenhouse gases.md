### Albedo
- **Albedo** - When light strikes an object, some of it is absorbed, and some of it is scattered.
- We define **albedo** in terms of scattered and incident power
	- $albedo = \dfrac{P_{scattereded}}{P_{ncident}}$ 
- Landforms, vegetation, weather, and seasons affect a planet's albedo 
### Emissivity 
- $Emissivity = \dfrac{\text{power radiated per unit area}}{\sigma T^4}$

# Greenhouse gases part 2
- Gas that contributes the most to the greenhouse effect in our atmosphere in descending order :
	- Water vapour ($H_2O$ )
	- Carbon dioxide ($CO_2$)
	- Nitrous oxide ($N_2O$)
	- Methane ($CH_4$)
	- ozone($O_3$)
## GWP(Global Warming potential)
- For human induced climate change, the gases all contain various potential. 
- **anthropogenic** - originating in human activity
## Reflected intensity vs radiated intensity
#### Reflected intensity
- Directly bounces solar energy back to space 
- does not contribute to Earth's heat
#### Radiated Intensity
- Earth absorbs solar energy and re-emits it
- often in infrared radiation 
- contributes to earth's thermal balance
## Absorption of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases
- Recall that solar radation strikes the earth at a rate of 1360
- The energy is carried in the form of photons, which are quanta of light 
- The atmosphere is made up of gas which are the first layer of matter that the sun's rays interact with. 
- If a photon is at the precis energy for an electron to jump to a different energy level in an atom, it will be absorbed. 
- The excited gas will eventually de-excite and release photons
- The absorption and release of photons by the gases is called **scattering**
- Scattering does not produce a net increase in heat energy in the atmosphere. 
- Greenhause gases are all molecular in nature 
For our purpose we will consider the triatomic molecule $CO_2$
