# Thermal energy, internal energy and heat
- **Internal Energy** - The sum of total kinetic energy and total potential energy of individual molecules and particles
- **Thermal Energy** - the energy associated withhea and temperature. Thermal energy appears as a result of friction, air resistance, impacts, and other interactions between obects. 
	- Thermal energy is a measurement of the random kinetic energy of vibrating particles in an object
	- Variable $E_{int}$ Unit: $J$
## Kinetic theory of matter
- All matter is composed of a very large number of small particles that are in constant motion
### Solids, liquids and gases

|                              | **solid**                                                        | **Liquid**                                                     | **Gas**                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **arrangement of particles** | regular patterns                                                 | no pattern                                                     | no pattern                       |
| **Forces between particles** | attractive and large enough to keep particles in their positions | some partiles have enough energy to overcome attractive forces | negligible under most conditions |
| **Separation of particles**  | close together                                                   | still close together                                           | much further apart               |
| **Motion of particles**      | vibrate in fixed positions                                       | some limited random movement is possible                       | all move in random directions and usually with high speeds


### Density
$$density = \dfrac{mass}{volume}, \rho = \dfrac mV si $$
Si unit: $kgm^{-3}$

- When solids and liquids are heated to a higher temperature, they will usually **expand** s/ightly in size. 
- Gas will expanded only if they are in a container that will allow that to happen

# Temperature
## Macroscopic understanding of temperature

- **Temperature** - describes how hot or cold an object is and determines the direction of heat flow between two bodies
- The resultant flow o thermal energy is always from higher temperature to lower temperature
- objects with no net transfer of thermal energy then the they are in  **thermal equilibrium*
- Being in **thermal contact** means energy can be transferred between them, by any means

### Kelvin scale of temperature

- its widely used in science
- **absolute zero** which is $-273.15 ^\circ C$ is experssed as $0K$
- They go up the same way so:
- $K = 273.15 +^\circ C$
