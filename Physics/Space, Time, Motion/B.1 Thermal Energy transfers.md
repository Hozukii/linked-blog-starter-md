# Thermal energy, internal energy and heat
- **Internal Energy** of a substance is the sum of total random kinetic energies and total potential energies of all the particles inside it
	- The word random means that the particles movement are disorder and unpredictable
- **Thermal Energy** - the energy associated with heat and temperature. Thermal energy appears as a result of friction, air resistance, impacts, and other interactions between obects. 
	- Thermal energy is a measurement of the random kinetic energy of vibrating particles in an object
	- Variable $E_{int}$ Unit: $J$
## Kinetic theory of matter
- All matter is composed of a very large number of small particles that are in constant motion
### Solids, liquids and gases

|                              | **solid**                                                        | **Liquid**                                                     | **Gas**                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **arrangement of particles** | regular patterns                                                 | no pattern                                                     | no pattern                       |
| **Forces between particles** | attractive and large enough to keep particles in their positions | some partiles have enough energy to overcome attractive forces | negligible under most conditions |
| **Separation of particles**  | close together                                                   | still close together                                           | much further apart               |
| **Motion of particles**      | vibrate in fixed positions                                       | some limited random movement is possible                       | all move in random directions and usually with high speeds


### Density
$$density = \dfrac{mass}{volume}, \rho = \dfrac mV si $$
Si unit: $kgm^{-3}$

- When solids and liquids are heated to a higher temperature, they will usually **expand** s/ightly in size. 
- Gas will expanded only if they are in a container that will allow that to happen

# Temperature
## Macroscopic understanding of temperature

- **Temperature** - describes how hot or cold an object is and determines the direction of heat flow between two bodies
- The resultant flow o thermal energy is always from higher temperature to lower temperature
- objects with no net transfer of thermal energy then the they are in  **thermal equilibrium*
- Being in **thermal contact** means energy can be transferred between them, by any means

### Kelvin scale of temperature

- its widely used in science
- **absolute zero** which is $-273.15 ^\circ C$ is experssed as $0K$
- They go up the same way so:
- $K = 273.15 +^\circ C$
## Microscopic understanding of temperature 
- Molecules that have lower average kinetic energy will collide with molecules that have higher average kinetic energy. Lower average kinetic energy will speed up, and higher average kinetic energy will slow down to become equivalent. 
- Higher the temperature, higher the average particle speed of the same gas
- Temperature(K) is proportional to the average random translational kinetic energy, $E_k$ of particles in a gas
- Molecules have rotational kinetic energy, and **vibrational kinetic energy** 
>[!abstract] Equations
>Average random translational kinetic energy of a gas particle: 
>$\overline E = \dfrac 32 k_b T$
>$k_B$ is known as **boltzmann constant**. It has a value $1.38 \cdot 10^{-23}JK^{-1}$
>Kelvin Temperature - $T$

- A temperature rise is equivalent to the particles gaining kinetic energy
## Internal energy 
- All substances contain moving particles. 
- moving particles have kinetic energy. 
- There are three forms of kinetic energy:
	- **Vibrational kinetic energy** - vibrating about fixe positions
	- **translational kinetic energy in liquids and gases** - particles moving from place to place
	- **rotational kinetic energy** - Molecules might be rotating 
- Particles have potential energy as well as kinetic energy. 
- In solids and liquids, the electrical forces keeps them from moving apart or moving closer together. 
- If the average separation of the particles in a solid or liquid increases, so too does their potential energy(and the total internal energy of the substance)
- In gasses however, forces between molecules are usually negligible.

# Thermal energy 
- Thermal energy is the transfer of energy because of a temperature difference
- There are three principal ways in which thermal energy can be transferred:
	- **Thermal conduction** - Kinetic energy is transferred between particles
	- **Convection** - differences in densities of liquids and gases result in their movement
	- **Thermal radiation** - electromagnetic radiation is emitted by surfaces 


## Thermal conduction
-  **Thermal conduction** - passage of thermal energy through a substance as energy is transferred from particle to particle 
- Thermal conduction occurs because of the transfer of kinetic energy between particles
- For solids, particles vibrate in fixed positions. Energy is transferred through the solid because of the forces / interactions between particles
- Solid are usually better thermal conductors because they of the closeness of the particles and the strength of forces between them. 
- **Insulator** materials significantly reduces the flow of thermal energy. 
### Quantitative treatment of thermal conductivity
>[!abstract] Rate of transfer of thermal energy by conduction:
>$\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = kA\dfrac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$
>Q = Thermal energy 
>t = time
>x = thickness
>$\Delta T = T_H - T_C$ = change in temperature
>k = **thermal conductivity**  of the substance
>A = area of contact

$\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ is the flow of energy per second = power which is measured in Watts
- Air is the best insulator but thermal energy can also be transferred by **convection currents**. Various kinds of foam consist mainly of air, but the foam limits the movement of that air.
