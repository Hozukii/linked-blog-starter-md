# The Nature of Force
- A force can be considered to be any type of interaction on an object
- All forces should be labelled with commonly accepted symbols or names 
# Different Types of Force 
[[contact force]] - Forces that involve physical contact (e.g. friction, pushes, pull)
[[Non-contact force]] - Forces that act "at a distance" across empty space. (magnetic forces and force of gravity 
## Weight
- Mass is measured in kg
- Mass does not change with location
- The weight,$F_g$ , of a mass, m is the gravitational force that pulls it towards the centre of the earth
- g is the weight: mass ratio, **Gravitation field strength** which in numerically equal to the acceleration due to gravity
# Contact forces
- **Tension** - pulling forces are acting tending to cause stretching
- **Compression** - Forces are pushing inwards on an object
- Both will tend to lead to **deformation**.
## Normal Force
- Normal Force -Force perpendicular to a surface
- Normal force occurs because the particles in the surfaces resist getting closer together.

## Buoyancy Forces
- Liquid also provide vertical forces upwards. Gases , too although it is often insignificant
- **Buoyancy** -  the ability of any fluid to provide a vertical upwards force on an object.
- Sometimes called **Upthrust**
- The magnitude of an upthrust will be greater in fluids of greater **density**
>[!info] Equation
>density($kgm^{-3}$, kilogram per cubic metre) = $\dfrac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \rho = \dfrac{m}{v}$

- 1 Litre of water has a volume of 1000$cm^3$ and has a mass of 1kg
- When a object is wholly or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences buoyancy force, $F_b$ equal to the weight of the fluid displaced. Since weight = mg and density, $\rho = \dfrac{m}{v}$,  $$F_b = \rho V g$$
- Archimedes' principle states that **a body immersed in a fluid is subjected to an upwards force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid**
For example:
```image-layout-a
![[Pasted image 20231008102423.png]]
![[Pasted image 20231008102432.png]]

```
- water has a density $1000kgm^{-3}$ 
- Convert $34cm^3$ to $m^3$
- $0.000034m^3$ = $34 \cdot 10^{-6} m^3$
- 29g to kilogram
- 29g = 0.029kg
- $F_g = 0.029 \cdot 9.81ms^{-2}$ 
- $F_g = 0.28449N$
- $F_b = \rho V g$
- $F_b = 1000kgm^{-3} \cdot (34 \cdot 10^{-6})m^3 \cdot 9.81ms^{-2}$
- $F_b = 0.33354kgms^{-2} or \space 0.33354N$
- Net force is: $F_b - F_g$
- $0.33354N- 0.28449N = 0.049N$ Upwards

### Floating
- The buoyancy force upwards will be equal to its weight downwards and there will be no overall force acting on it
## Elastic resorting forces
- When a force acts on an object it can change its shape: **deformation**
- If an object returns to its original shape, the deformation was **Elastic**
- If an object does not return to the same condition as before their use, it has passed its **elastic limit** 
---
### How deformation depends on force
- For example with steel spring, the weight provide the downwards force, F. In this case the deformation is called [[extension]] of the spring, x, and usually plotted horizonal axis
![[Pasted image 20231008105429.png]]
- the force, F, and the extension, x are proportional to each other, up to a limit
- The constant of proportionality is given the symbol k: F = kx
- **k** is a measurement of "stiffness" of the spring commonly called the **spring constant**
- The elastic limit if often assumed to be close to or the same as the **limit of proportionality** 
$$k = \dfrac{\Delta F}{\Delta x}$$
### Hooke's law
- $F_H = -kx$
- essentially the same as F = kx, but the symbol $F_H$ referts to the **restoring force** within the spring 
	- Equal in magnitude but opposite in direction

## Surface Friction
- Occurs when we move an object over another surface, forces parallel to the surfaces will resist movement. 
- The applied force need to initially move the object is $F_{max}$. The block then starts to move within a steady force which is less than  $F_{max}$
- When the friction force is equal equal to the applied force, it is stationary, and is **static friction** 
- The magnitude of static friction force can increase form zero to a maximum value, $F_{max}$ 
- once the object is moving, the reduced friction is called **dynamic Friction**
![[Pasted image 20231008110022.png | 550]]
- The Constant of proportionality equals the gradient of the  graph called the **coefficient of friction** $\mu$ (no units)
- **Coefficient of friction** - Constants used to represent the amount of friction between two different surfaces.
![[Pasted image 20231008110216.png| 350]]
>[!seealso] Coefficient of friction
>Just before motion begins: $F_f = F_{max} = \mu_sF_N,$ where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of the static friction 
> $0 \le \mu \le 1$

## Friction of Objects with Air and Liquids
- **Drag** is friction in fluids, and use the symbol $F_d$
- Typically, for small objects moving slowly $F_d \propto v$
- But for larger objects, moving more quickly, $F_d \propto v^2$
### Viscosity and Stokes' law 
- **Viscosity**  - resistance of a fluid to movement
- Greater viscosity will tend to increase drag, and when this is the dominant factor, we refer to **viscous drag**
- Viscosity, $\eta$ , has the SI unit of **Pas** ($kgm^{-1}s^{-1}$)
- Viscosity of liquids can be very dependent on temperature
>[!seealso] **Stokes' law**
>- To understand viscosity we can use Stokes' law 
>- Stokes' law - equation for the viscous drag on a ==smooth, spherical object undergoing non-turbulent motion==
> $$F_d = 6 \pi \eta rv$$
# Field Forces 
- The three forces are
	- Gravitational force, $F_g$
	- Electric force, $F_e$
	- Magnetic force $F_m$
- Work without needing mass between
- ==Forces acting on a body can be represented in a free-body diagram==
## Resultant forces and Component
- A **resultant force** is represented in size and direction by the diagonal of the parallelogram which has the two original force vectors as adjacent sides. 
- A single force can be considered as being equivalent to two small forces. The two separate forces are called **components**.
# Newton's law of motion
[[Newton's law of motion]]
- They describe the relationship between force and motion

## Newton's First Law of Motion
>[!info] first law
>An object at rest **remains** at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at **constant** speed and in a straight line **unless** acted on by an **unbalanced** force.

- In other words, an resultant force will produce an acceleration
- When the influences on any system  are **balanced**, we describe it as being in **equilibrium**.(another example is when an objects stays at the same temperature, we say that it is in thermal equilibrium)
- When there is no resultant force on an object, we say that it is in **translational equilibrium** 
>[!abstract] Examples
>On Earth all objects have weight so it is impossible for an object to be in equilibrium because there are no forces acting on it.
>Translational equilibrium arises when two or more forces are balanced.
>- A book on a horizontal table
>- A stationary block on a slope
>- A cyclist moving with constant speed

## Newton's second law of motion
# $F = ma$
- This version assumes that that the mass of the object is constant(we can use change in momentum to calculate objects with changing mass)
- When discussing gravitational force, $F_g$ / and the acceleration involved is g,
    - $F_g = mg$
- **Inertia** - resistance to a change of motion. Depends on the mass of the object
    - So mass is a measure of inertia

>[!abstract] Non-mathematical applications of Newton's second law
>Why a glass will break when dropped on the floor, but may survive being dropped onto a sofa. A collision with the floor is much shorter than a collision with the sofa meaning the deceleration will be greater and using F = ma the force will be greater and probably more destructive.

# Newton's third Law
>[!info] Third Law
>whenever one body exerts a force on another body, the second body exerts a force of the same magnitude on the first , but in the opposite reaction

- Every action has a equal and opposite reaction
- They are always the same type (eg. friction then friction, gravity then gravity)
- When two objects, A and B, interact, $F_A = -F_B$
- Using second law, $[ma]_A = -[ma]_B$
- The time of the interaction is the same for both.
- Mass x velocity is called momentum. The momentum gained by object A = momentum lost by object B. Always. This assumes that there are no external forces. 
# Momentum
>[!info] Momentum
>Linear momentum (Si unit: $kgms^[-1]$) = mass x velocity, **p = mv**

- Momentum is a [[vector quantity]] and its direction is always important. 
- Is an **isolated system** the change of momentum for one object is equal and opposite to the change in momentum of the other, since the time of interaction is same for both objects
- It's also because of the Law of conservation of momentum
	- Law of conservation of momentum - The Total momentum of any system is constant, provided there is no result, provided that there is no resultant external force acting on it
- This law of physics is always true with no exceptions.
- We know that, for uniform acceleration: 
- $F = ma = \dfrac{m(v-u)}{t} = \dfrac{mv-mu}{t}$
- This demonstrates an alternative, more generalized, interpretation of Newton's second law in terms of a **Change in momentum**, $\Delta p$
F = rate of change of momentum: $F = \dfrac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$
This allows for a possibility of a changing mass. 
## Conservation of Momentum in Collisions and Explosions
**Collision** - any event in which two, or more, objects move towards each other and exert forces on each other. 
**Explosion** - any event in which internal forces within a stationary system result in separate parts of the system moving apart. 
### Collisions
- We can use conservation of momentum to help predict what will happen immediately after a collision
- worked Example
	- ![[Pasted image 20231010182802.png]] 
### Kinetic Energy in collisions
- Any moving object has kinetic energy and during a collision some, or all , of this energy will be transferred between the colliding objects. 
- A collision in which the *Total* kinetic energy before and after the collision is the same is called an **elastic collision** 
- A collision after which the colliding objects stick together is called a **totally inelastic collision**
## Explosions
- If the objects are identical, and they have a hammer striking in the middle, they will move apart with equal speeds. 
- If the mass on one side is double, then the speeds will be in the ratio of 2:1
# Collisions and Explosions in Two Dimensions (HL)
![[Pasted image 20231010184806.png| 200]]
Two objects, $m_1$ and $m_2$, before and after a collsion . In this example, $m_2$ is stationary before collision
- For collisions or explosions in two dimensions the law of conservation of momentum can be applied in two perpendicular directions
## Propulsion 
**Propel** - provide a force for an intended motion
- To start, or maintain motion (propel), we can create momentum in the opposite direction. 
- Propeller can also be used, also jet engines, or even rocket engines. 
# Forces acting for short times: impulses
**Impulse**, J(not related to Joules), the product of force and the time for which the force acts.
>[!note] impulse
>$J = F\Delta t$ SI unit: Ns

- If force varies during interaction, just use the average force.
- We know, $F = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$ which is $F\Delta t = \Delta p, thus,$$$J = \Delta p$$
## Force-time graphs
- If we need to know the impulse of a non constant force impulse accurately, we can use graphs. 
- ==The Area under any force-time graph for an interaction equals force x time, which equals impulse==

# Circular Motion and Centripetal forces
- A object moving along a circular path with constant speed has continuously changing velocity because its *direction* is always changing. 
- Circular motion theory can be useful when discussing the orbits of planets, moons, and satellites. 
- **Centripetal force** - the name given to any force which results in motion along a circular path. 
	- A centripetal force continuously changes direction so that it is always acting perpendicularly to the instantaneous velocity. 
	- ![[Pasted image 20231011192021.png]]
## Identifying different types of centripetal force
- *Gravity* provides centripetal force for planets
- *tension* provides centripetal force for an object being spun around on a string in an horizontal circle. 
- *Friction* provides centripetal force for a vehicle, cyclist or a person, moving in a curved path on a horizontal surface. 
- *Electrical Force* provide the centripetal force for electrons moving around the nuclei of atoms. 
## Centripetal Acceleration
- Centripetal force towards the centre of any circular motion must result in a **centripetal acceleration** 
## Mathematics of Uniform Circular Motion
>[!seealso] 
>$v = \dfrac{2 \pi r}{T}$
>m is the mass moving in constant linear speed, v, in a circle of radius r
>T is the **time period**: time taken to complete a rotation. 

![[Pasted image 20231012212631.png| 400]]

The **frequency**, $f$, of the motion is the number of rotations in unit time, one second. SI unit: Hertz, Hz
That's why monitors can be 144hz meaning 144 rotations in one second. 

$$f = \dfrac{1}{T}$$

- **angular velocity**, $\omega$ , the rate at which an object rotates. 
- Angular velocity = $\dfrac{\text{change of angle}}{\text{time taken}}$
- It can be measured in degrees per second. So that a constant angualear velocity in degrees per second would be $\dfrac{360}{T}$
>[!info] equation
>$\omega = \dfrac{2 \pi}{T} = 2 \pi f$
>SI unit: $rads^{-1}$

Comparing with $v = \dfrac{2 \pi r}{T}$, it should be clear that: $v = \omega r$
### Equation for centripetal acceleration and force 
- If a object is moving in a circle of radius r has a constant linear speed, v,  its centripetal acceleration, a , will have a numerical value. 
- **a** represents how quickly the object's direction of motion is changing. 
- $a = \dfrac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r = \dfrac{4 \pi^2 r}{T^2}$
---
- We know F = ma
- Therefore: $F = \dfrac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r$
# Non-uniform Circular motion 
### Vertical motion 
- In vetical motion, the centripetal force is affected by the combination of, tension in the string, $F_T$ and gravity, $F_g$. 
### Horizontal motion
- In horzontal motion such as a turntable, then you must think about friction. So you must add up the Force needed to change angle and to cancel out friction.
