# Rotational dynamics
*We will assume that the bodies are rigid*
- **dynamics** - branch of physics concerned with motion and its causes.
- **Rotation** - refers to movement about an axis within the body
	- It does not concern with location
- **revolution** - usually concerns movement of a body around an exterior point 
## comparing rotational motion to linear motion
we can compare our understanding of linear dynamics to rotational dynamics 

| linear motion                 | Rotational motion        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| force                         | torque                   |
| mass (measurement of inertia) | moment of inertia        |
| Linear displacement           | angular displacement     |
| linear speed / velocity       | angular speed / velocity |
| linear acceleration           | angular acceleration     |
| linear momentum               | angular momentum         |
| linear kinetic energy         | rotational kinetic energy       |

## Torque

>[!note] Torque
>the torque, $\uptau$, of a force about an axis, 
>Given by: $\uptau = Fr \space sin(\theta)$

- It is important to identify the place where rotation occur
	- Most commonly this will involve an axis of rotation(Terms pivot, hinge, and fulcrum are often used for situations in which movement is not complete, nor continuous)
- **Line of action** - A straight line in which a force is applied
	- Any force applied not on the object's line of action will tend to start , or change, rotational motion if possible
