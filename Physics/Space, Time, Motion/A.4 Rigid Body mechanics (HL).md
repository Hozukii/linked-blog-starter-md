# Rotational dynamics
*We will assume that the bodies are rigid*
- **dynamics** - branch of physics concerned with motion and its causes.
- **Rotation** - refers to movement about an axis within the body
	- It does not concern with location
- **revolution** - usually concerns movement of a body around an exterior point 
## comparing rotational motion to linear motion
we can compare our understanding of linear dynamics to rotational dynamics 

| linear motion                 | Rotational motion        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| force                         | torque                   |
| mass (measurement of inertia) | moment of inertia        |
| Linear displacement           | angular displacement     |
| linear speed / velocity       | angular speed / velocity |
| linear acceleration           | angular acceleration     |
| linear momentum               | angular momentum         |
| linear kinetic energy         | rotational kinetic energy       |

# Torque

>[!note] Torque
>- the torque, $\uptau$, of a force about an axis, 
>- Given by: $\uptau = Fr \space sin\theta$
>- SI unit: $Nm$ (not $Nm^{-1}$) while he same unit as joules, it is not equivalent
>- vector quantity




- It is important to identify the place where rotation occur
	- Most commonly this will involve an axis of rotation(Terms pivot, hinge, and fulcrum are often used for situations in which movement is not complete, nor continuous)
- **Line of action** - A straight line in which a force is applied
	- Any force applied not on the object's line of action will tend to start , or change, rotational motion if possible

- $F_1$ has no turning effect 
- $F_2$ has the biggest turning effect
- $F_3$ is somewhere in between
- Also depends of the distance, $r$ from the axis of rotation
- the "turning effect" of a force, $F$ is the **torque**
- **Torque** $\uptau = Fr \space sin\theta$
--- 

- When there is no actual rotation, torque is sometimes called the **moment** of a force
## combining torques

- Torque is a vector quantity but generally we will only be concerned about where it tends to produce clockwise or anticlockwise motion
#### couples
- **Couples** - pair of equal-sized forces that have different line of action but which are parallel to each other and act in opposite directions, either side of the axis of rotation. 
- A couple produces no resultant force, therefore no translational acceleration
