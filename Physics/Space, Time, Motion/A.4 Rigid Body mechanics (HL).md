# Rotational dynamics
*We will assume that the bodies are rigid*
- **dynamics** - branch of physics concerned with motion and its causes.
- **Rotation** - refers to movement about an axis within the body
	- It does not concern with location
- **revolution** - usually concerns movement of a body around an exterior point 
## comparing rotational motion to linear motion
we can compare our understanding of linear dynamics to rotational dynamics 

| linear motion                 | Rotational motion        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| force                         | torque                   |
| mass (measurement of inertia) | moment of inertia        |
| Linear displacement           | angular displacement     |
| linear speed / velocity       | angular speed / velocity |
| linear acceleration           | angular acceleration     |
| linear momentum               | angular momentum         |
| linear kinetic energy         | rotational kinetic energy       |
