Take any container and a any number gas molecules inside. Gas molecules are constantly changing in direction. Therefore it's always accelerating
- The force comes from the sides of the container
- The walls of the container experiences a force dependent on the number of times and velocity of a gas molecule that hits it. This is called "pressure"
## Pressure
**Pressure** - defined as perpendicular force per unit area $P = \dfrac{F}{A}$
- Pressure is measured in, $Nm^{-2}$ or pascals (Pa)
- One bar = 100 00 Pa
- the standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa, equivalent to 760mmHg
## Amount of a substance
**amount of a substance, n** - measure of the number of atomic-scale particles it contains. 
- Even very small amounts of gas can contain an enormously large number of particles. 
>[!info] Mole
>- One mole is the amount of a substance that contains exactly $6.022140176 \cdot 10^23 of its particles$
>- Known as the **Avogadro constant**, given the symbol $N_A$
>- For most calculation we use $6.02 \cdot 10^{23}$

The amonut of substance in moles = $\dfrac{\text{number of particles}}{\text{Avogadro constant}}$
$$n = \dfrac N{N_A}$$
- **molar mass** - the mass of a substance that contains 1 mole of its defining particles
## Investigating the physical properties of gases
### Boyle's law
- states that equal pressure is inversely proportional to volume (when temperature is constant)
- For fixed amount of gas at constant temperature: $P \propto \dfrac 1 V$
$$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$

### Charles law 
- States that volume is proportional to temperature(when pressure is constant). *Temperature must be in kelvin*
- For a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure: $V \propto T(K)$

$$\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{V_2}{T_2}$$
### Gay-Lussac's Law / Pressure law 
- States that pressure is proportional to temperature (When volume is constant). Must be Kelvin
- For a fixed amount o gas at constant volume: $P \propto T$
$$\dfrac{P_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2}{T_2}$$
