Take any container and a any number gas molecules inside. Gas molecules are constantly changing in direction. Therefore it's always accelerating
- The force comes from the sides of the container
- The walls of the container experiences a force dependent on the number of times and velocity of a gas molecule that hits it. This is called "pressure"
## Pressure
**Pressure** - defined as perpendicular force per unit area $P = \dfrac{F}{A}$
- Pressure is measured in, $Nm^{-2}$ or pascals (Pa)
- One bar = 100 00 Pa
- the standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa, equivalent to 760mmHg
## Amount of a substance
**amount of a substance, n** - measure of the number of atomic-scale particles it contains. 
- Even very small amounts of gas can contain an enormously large number of particles. 
>[!info] Mole
>- One mole is the amount of a substance that contains exactly $6.022140176 \cdot 10^{23} \text{of its particles}$
>- Known as the **Avogadro constant**, given the symbol $N_A$
>- For most calculation we use $6.02 \cdot 10^{23}$

The amonut of substance in moles = $\dfrac{\text{number of particles}}{\text{Avogadro constant}}$
$$n = \dfrac N{N_A}$$
- **molar mass** - the mass of a substance that contains 1 mole of its defining particles

## Investigating the physical properties of gases
### Boyle's law
- states that equal pressure is inversely proportional to volume (when temperature is constant)
- For fixed amount of gas at constant temperature: $P \propto \dfrac 1 V$
$$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$

### Charles law 
- States that volume is proportional to temperature(when pressure is constant). *Temperature must be in kelvin*
- For a fixed amount of gas at constant pressure: $V \propto T(K)$

$$\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{V_2}{T_2}$$
### Gay-Lussac's Law / Pressure law 
- States that pressure is proportional to temperature (When volume is constant). Must be Kelvin
- For a fixed amount o gas at constant volume: $P \propto T$
$$\dfrac{P_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2}{T_2}$$
### Combined Gas law
- for a fixed amount of gas, $PV \propto T$
$$\dfrac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$$
- So far, we have only discussed fixed amount of gas. we need to include *any* kind of gas
- Pressure of a fixed volume of gas at constant temperature is $\propto$ the amount of gas
- This leads us to $PV \propto nRT$
#### Pressure-volume diagrams 
**PV diagram** - a graphical way of representing changes to the state of gas during a thermodynamic process
- The state of a known amount of gas, as defined by values of its pressure, volume and teperature, can be identified as a point on a pressure.
# Modelling gas behaviour: ideal gases 
Gasses aren't really that consistent
- Therefore, we make an approximation
- For this... we have an **ideal gas**
- **Ideal gas** - imaginary gas that is used to model real gases, and has the following properties
	- identical perfect spheres
	- Perfectly elastic collisions
	- no intermolecular forces - potential energy does not change
	- so small that their volume is much smaller than the volume of their container
	- There are no forces between the particles, except when they collide.

####  Universal gas constant

- R is the macroscopic equivalent to the **Boltzmann constant, k**
	- Discussed in: [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Microscopic understanding of temperature]]
## Mathematical model for gas behaviour
- We will consider one particle in a 
- Pressure of an ideal gas:
$$ P = \dfrac 13 Nm \dfrac{v^2} V $$
since $Nm$ is the total mass of the gas, $\dfrac {Nm} V$ is the density of the gas, $\rho$, leadig to an alternative expression:
$$P = \dfrac 13 pv^2$$
## Internal energy of an ideal gas
- **internal energy of an ideal gas,** $U$, - the sum of the random translational kinetic energies of all molecules.
- It can be calculated by multiplying the number of particles by their average random translational kinetic energy
$$ U = N \cdot \dfrac12 mv^2$$
- Comparing $PV = nRT$ with $PV = \dfrac 13 Nmv^2$ we see that: $nRT = \dfrac 13 Nmv^2$
- rewritten as:
$$nRT = \dfrac 23 U$$
- Which is internal energy of an ideal gas
- if we divide $U$ by number of particles, $N$ we get the *average random translational kinetic energy of a single atom of an ideal gas*, $\bar E_k$
$$\bar E_k = \dfrac 32 \dfrac{nRT}{N}$$

- Since $\dfrac nM$ = Avogadro constant, $N_A$, so that: $\bar E_k = \dfrac 32 \dfrac {RT}{N_A}$
- Since $k_B = \dfrac RN_A$, Boltzmann constant, 
- $\bar E_k = \dfrac 32 k_B T$ which is the average translational kinetic energy of a gas particle mentioned before,
- [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Microscopic understanding of temperature]]
- At the same temperature, all gasses contain molecules with the same average random translational kinetic energy
- Now we know that, Internal energy of an ideal monatomic gas: $U = \dfrac 32 N k_B T$
- We can also re-write the ideal gas law as: $PV = N K_B T$
## Real gases compared to ideal gases
- Most **real gases** behave like ideal gases unless their pressure or density is very high, or the temperature is very low. 
##### More info
- This will not be true if there are significant differences from the stated assumptions of ideal gas such as:
- at high densities, particles will be closer together than assumed. The forces between them may not be negligible
- At low temperature, forces between particles will have greater effect because they are moving slower. Most real gases will also turn into liquids and so
