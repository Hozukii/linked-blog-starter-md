- **Green house effect** - The natural effect that a planet's atmosphere has on reducing the amount of radiation emitted into space, resulting in a planet warmer than it would be without an atmosphere. 
- However  human activity has changed the atmopshere in ways that are making the Earth warmer known as the **enhanced greenhouse effect**
# A planet's energy balance: an introduction
- Since the only thermal energy which can travel across Space is radiation, for a planet at constant average temperature:
	- the radiant thermal energy received is equal to the radiant thermal energy emitted in the same interval. 

# Luminosity and apparent brightness of the sun: the solar constant
- **Wien's law** - equation determine the surface temperature of planets. 
	- Discussed on: [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Wien's displacement law]]
- Using Wien's law we can determine that the temperate of the sun is **5780K**
- We can find the luminosity, using Stephan Boltzmann's law  $L_{\odot} = \sigma AT^4$
	- Also discussed on [[B.1 Thermal Energy transfers#Black bodies]]
- $L_{\odot} = \sigma AT^4 = (5.67 \cdot 10^{-8}) \cdot (6.05 \cdot 10^{18}) \cdot 5780^4 = 3.83 \cdot 10^{26} W$
- We can also calculate the apparent brightness, b, of the sun just above the earth's atmosphere: $\text{intensity} = \dfrac{power}{area} \space I = \dfrac PA$
- $b = \dfrac{L_{\odot}}{4 \pi d^2} = 1360Wm^{-2}$
- **Solar constant**, S - intensity of the sun's radiation arriving perpendicularly on an area above the Earth's atmosphere

- The mean value of the radiative intensity directed at the surface of the planet is: $S \cdot (\dfrac{\pi r^2}{4\pi r^2}) = \dfrac{S}{4}$
