# Electric Charge
- **electric charge** - fundamental property of some subatomic particles that makes them experience electric forces when they interact with other charges. Charges can be *positive* or *negative*
	- [[D.2]] 
- There are two kinds of force: attractive and repulsive
	- We call these charge *positive* and *negative* charge
	- positive and negative charges are often described as **opposite charges**
- Charges of opposite sign attract each other. Charges of same sign repel each other.
- - Charge is generally given the symbol $q$ 
- Charge is measured in **coulumbs**, C. 
	- One coulomb is relatively large so we often use microcoulombs($1\micro C = 10^{-6}C$) and nanocoulombs($1nC = 10^{-9}$)
	- One Coulomb of negative charge is the total charge of $6.28 \cdot 10^{18}$ electrons
- Protons and neutrons are to be found in the nucleus of the atom. Electrons are located in the space around the nucleus. 
- All **protons** have a *positive* charge of $+1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- All **electrons** have a *negative* charge of $-1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- charge of magnitude $1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$ is called the **elementary charge** given the symbol $e$ 
- Intermediate values between the elementary charges are not possible (atleast without quarks)
## Law of conservation of charge
- The total charge in an isolated system remains constant. 
## Electric currents
- **Current**, I - a flow of electric charge. Equal to the amount of charge passing a point in unit time: $I = \dfrac {\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
- **charge carrier** - A charged particle which is free to move
- Some of the electrons in the atom of metals have enough energy that they are no longer attracted to a particular metal ion. we say that they are **delocalized electrons** or **free electrons**
	- **Delocalized electrons** = Electrons which are not bound to any particular atom or molecule

- When there is no electric current, free electrons normally move around randomly in metals at high speeds, somewhat like a molecules in a gas. 
- When they form an electric current, am uch slower, "drift" speed in the direct of the current is added to the electrons' random movements. 
>[!abstract] Electric current
>We define the magnitude of an electric current as the amount of charge that passes a point in unit time:
>Electric current, $I = \dfrac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$

- **Direct current(dc)** - A flow of electric charge that is always in the same direction
- **Alternating current (ac)** - A flow of electric charge that changes direction periodically
- **Ampere**, A - Unit of electric current:
	- $1A = \dfrac{1C}{1 \space second}$
	- C - Coulomb
