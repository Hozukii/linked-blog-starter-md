# Electric Charge
- **electric charge** - fundamental property of some subatomic particles that makes them experience electric forces when they interact with other charges. Charges can be *positive* or *negative*
	- [[D.2]] 
- There are two kinds of force: attractive and repulsive
	- We call these charge *positive* and *negative* charge
	- positive and negative charges are often described as **opposite charges**
- Charges of opposite sign attract each other. Charges of same sign repel each other.
-  Charge is generally given the symbol $q$ 
- Charge is measured in **coulumbs**, C. 
	- One coulomb is relatively large so we often use microcoulombs($1\micro C = 10^{-6}C$) and nanocoulombs($1nC = 10^{-9}$)
	- One Coulomb of negative charge is the total charge of $6.28 \cdot 10^{18}$ electrons
- Protons and neutrons are to be found in the nucleus of the atom. Electrons are located in the space around the nucleus. 
- All **protons** have a *positive* charge of $+1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- All **electrons** have a *negative* charge of $-1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$
- charge of magnitude $1.60 \cdot 10^{-19}$ is called the **elementary charge** given the symbol $e$ 
- Intermediate values between the elementary charges are not possible (atleast without quarks)
## Law of conservation of charge
- The total charge in an isolated system remains constant. 
## Electric currents
- **Current**, I - a flow of electric charge. Equal to the amount of charge passing a point in unit time: $I = \dfrac {\Delta q}{\Delta t}$
- **charge carrier** - A charged particle which is free to move
- Some of the electrons in the atom of metals have enough energy that they are no longer attracted to a particular metal ion. we say that they are **delocalized electrons** or **free electrons**
	- **Delocalized electrons** = Electrons which are not bound to any particular atom or molecule

- When there is no electric current, free electrons normally move around randomly in metals at high speeds, somewhat like a molecules in a gas. 
- When they form an electric current, a much slower, "drift" speed in the direct of the current is added to the electrons' random movements. 
>[!abstract] Electric current
>We define the magnitude of an electric current as the amount of charge that passes a point in unit time:
>Electric current, $I = \dfrac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}$

- **Direct current(dc)** - A flow of electric charge that is always in the same direction
- **Alternating current (ac)** - A flow of electric charge that changes direction periodically
- **Ampere**, A - Unit of electric current:
	- $1A = \dfrac{1C}{1 \space second}$
	- C - Coulomb 
## Electrical Circuits 
- Circuit diagrams represent the arrangement of components in a circuit.
- **Circuit** - A complete conducting path that enables an electric current to continuously transfer energy from a voltage source to various electrical components
- **Electric cell** - Device that transfers chemical energy to the energy carried by an electric current
	- **Battery** - One or more electric cells
- **Electrical terminals** - points at which connecting wires are joined to electrical components
- Electric current is *always* shown flowing from positive to negative around any circuit
	- Although electrons move in the opposite way
	- This is called **conventional current**

## Potential difference / voltage
- voltage of a battery , or other source of electrical energy, is a measure of how much energy it can supply to the charge carriers flowing through it. 
- One **volt** means that one joule of energy is transferred by each coulomb of charge moving between two specified points
- $1V = \dfrac{joule}{coulomb}$ , $JC^{-1}$
- **voltage** has become widely used term for the physical quantity that is measured by volts . However, the correct term is **potential difference**
- **potential difference**, V - The energy transferred by unit positive charge moving between two points. 
	- $V = \dfrac{W}{q}$

- A charge will move because of a *difference in electrical potential* if it is free to do so.
- Like gravitational potential energy discussed in [[D.1]] and [[D.2]]
## Electrical resistance
- **Electrical conductor** - A material through which an electric current can flow because it contains significant numbers of mobile charges
- **Electrical resistance** - Ratio of potential difference across a conductor to the current
- **Electrical Insulator** - A non-conductor 
- If currents are relatively large, the components are described as good **electrical conductors** with low **electrical resistance**
- If the currents are small, or negligible, the material is described as good **electrical insulator**, with a high electrical resistance
- **Semiconductors** - Material with a resistivity between that of conductors and insulators. (essential to modern electronics.)
	- Most notably silicon and germanium
- The greater the number of mobile charge carriers in a given volume of material, the lower we would expect the resistance to be. 
- When the  free electrons move through the conductor they will collide / interact with vibrating metal ions and this is the cause of electrical resistance. 
- We know that particle vibrations in a solid decrease at lower temperatures, so resistance can be reduced by cooling. 
>[!abstract] Elecrical Resistance
>Electrical resistance, R:
>$$\text{electrical resistance} = \dfrac{\text{potential difference}}{current} \space R = \dfrac VI$$
>SI unit: **ohm**$\Omega$ 
>	1$\Omega = 1VA^{-1}$

### Determining resistance values
- **I-V characteristic** - Graph of current - potential difference representing the basic behavior of an electrical current
- **Ohm's law** - The current in a conductor is proportional to the potential difference across it, provided temperature is constant $I \propto V$ 
	- Any component that behaves like this is described as being **ohmic**: 
![[Pasted image 20231220182416.png | 600]]

- **diode** - An electrical component that only allows current to flow in one direction
### Resistors
- Wires and ammeters, usually have negligible resistance
- **Resistor** - A resistance made to have a specific value or range of values
- **Variable resistors** - A resistor that can be used to control currents and/ or potential differences in in a circuit
![[Resistor symbols.png]]
### Electrical resistivity
1. **Resistance of a uniform wire is proportional to its length,$l$**
	![[Pasted image 20231221183030.png|400]]
1. **The resistance of a uniform wire is inversly proportional to its cross-sectional area, $A$**
	- ![[Pasted image 20231221183056.png|400]]
- Combining the results, we get: 
	- $R \propto \dfrac lA$
	- $R = constant \cdot \dfrac lA$
- The *constant* is **resistivity**
>[!abstract] Resistivity
>- **Resistivity, $\rho$** - Resistance of a specimen of a material that has a length of 1m and cross-sectional area of $1m^2$
>- 
>$$Resistivity,\rho = \dfrac {RA}{L}$$
>si unit: $\Omega m$

#### Variation of resistivity with temperature
- The number of free electrons in metals will not increase significantly unless temperatures are exterem. 
- However, it can be very different for semiconductors and insulators
- The number of charge carriers in non-metals can increase significantly thus resistance can decrease considerably.
# Connecting two or more components in the same circuit
- Components can be connected in series, in parallel, or combination of the two. 
![[Pasted image 20231221184133.png]]
- This shows a **series connection**
	- **Series connection** - Two or more electrical components connected such that there is only one path for the electrical current, which is the same through all the components
- Currents in series: $I = I_1 = I_2 =...$
- Potential differences in series: $V = V_1 + V_2 + ...$
- Using $V = IR$ for teh individuals resistors, we get $IR_S = IR_1 + IR_3 + IR_3$, so that we can derive an equation for the single resistor, $R_S$ which has the same resistnace as the combination
- The total resistance of resistors in series: $R_s = R_1 + R_2 +...$
![[Pasted image 20231221184649.png]]
- This shows **Parallel connection**
	- Two or more electrical components connected between the same two points, so that they have the same potential difference across them. 
- Potential differences in parallel: $V = V_1 = V_2 = ...$
- Currents in parallel: $I = I_1 + I_2 + ...$
- Applying $I = \dfrac VR$ throughout gives:
	- $\dfrac VR_P = \dfrac VR_1 + \dfrac VR_2 + \dfrac VR_3$
- The total resistors in parallel can be determined from: $\dfrac 1R_p = \dfrac 1R_1 + \dfrac 1R_2+...$ 
## Emf and internal resistance
- **Dynamo** - A type of electricity generator that produces direct current. Converts kinetic energy to electrical
### Emf
- **Electromotive force $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$** , - The total energy transferred in a source of electrical energy per unit charge passing through it
- For example: a battery with an emf of 12V can transfer a total of 12J to every coulomb of charge that flows through it. 
### Internal resistance
- Cells, batteries and other source of electrical energy are made from materials which all have resistance, called the **internal resistance,$r$** of the source.
	- Typically less than $1\Omega$ 
- If the internal resistance of a battery is much less than the resistance of the rest of the circuit, its effect can usually be ignored. 
- Internal resistances can vary with temperature and the age of the battery, but we will assume that they are constant
![[Pasted image 20231221190706.png|300]]
- **Lost volt** - Term sometimes used to describe the voltage drop that cocurs when a source of electrical energy delivers a current to a circuit. Lost volts increase with larger currents
- **Terminal potential difference** - The potential difference across the terminals of a bettry whin it is supplying a current to a circuit. 
- Total energy transferred by the cell (per coulomb) = energy transferred to the circuit (per coulomb) + energy transferred inside the cell (per coulomb)
- emf of cell = terminal p.d. across circuit + "lost volts" due to internal resistance of battery
- $\varepsilon = V_t + V_r$
- The current flows through both resistances, so that using $V = IR$ 
- $\varepsilon = I(R+ r)$
## Using variable resistors
- **rheostat** - variable resistance used to control current
	- ![[Pasted image 20231222103639.png|400]]
- Many variable resistances have three terminals, one at each of the resistance and a third sliding contact between them. 
### Potentiometers 
- **potentiometer** - A three terminal variable resistor when its sliding contact is being used to produce a varying p.d.
