## Boyle's law
- states that equal pressure is inversely proportional to volume (when temperature is constant)
$$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$
p = pressure of the gas
V = volume of the gas
Pressure is measured in, $Nm^{-2}$ or pascals (Pa)
One bar = 100 00 Pa
the standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa, equivalent to 760mmHg

## Charles law 
- States that volume is proportional to temperature(when pressure is constant). *Temperature must be in kelvin*
$$\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{V_2}{T_2}$$
v - volume of gas 
T - temperature of gas



## Gay-Lussac's Law
- States that pressure is proportional to temperature (When volume is constant). Must be Kelvin
$$\dfrac{P_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2}{T_2}$$
p - pressure of gas
T - temperature of gas

## Combined Gas law
$$\dfrac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$$
# Pressure and a gas
- Take any container and a any number gas molecules inside. Gas molecules are constantly changing in direction. Therefore it's always accelerating
- The force comes from the sides of the container
- The walls of the container experiences a force dependent on the number of times and velocity of a gas molecule that hits it. This is called "pressure"
## Some issues with the idea
- Gasses aren't really that consistent
- Therefore, we make an approximation
- For this... we have an **ideal gas**
- **Ideal gas** - imaginary gas that is used to model real gases, and has the following properties
	- identical perfect spheres
	-
