- **Thermodynamics** - Branch of physics involving transfers of thermal energy to do useful work
# Work done when Gas Expands
- **Isobaric **- Occuring at constant pressure
- Work done = force x distance
- Work done by gas = force x distance moved in direction of force
- Force = Pressure x area 
- Distance in this case is change in volume $\Delta V = A\Delta s$ 
>[!abstract] Isobaric work
>- Work done when a gas changes volume at constant pressure, $W = P\Delta V$

- **State of a gas** - Specified by quoting the pressure, P, T, V, n

# First law of Thermodynamics
- Thermal energy supplied to a gas:
$$Q = \Delta U + W$$
$U$ - internal energy
$W$ - work done
- We can use the principle of conservatin of energy, the gas may gain internal energy, U, and / or the gas will expand and do work on the sorroundings, W
## Changes in internal energy of an ideal monatomic gas
We've seen in [[B.3 Gas laws#Internal energy of an ideal gas]] that the internal energy of an ideal monatomic gas can be calculated from:
$$U = \dfrac 32 Nk_B T = \dfrac 32 nRT $$
So the change in internal energy, $\Delta U$ of an ideal monatomic gas can be calculated from:

$$\Delta U = \dfrac 32 Nk_B \Delta T = \dfrac 32 nR\Delta T$$
