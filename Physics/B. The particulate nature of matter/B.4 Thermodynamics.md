- **Thermodynamics** - Branch of physics involving transfers of thermal energy to do useful work
# Work done when Gas Expands
- **Isobaric **- Occuring at constant pressure
- Work done = force x distance
- Work done by gas = force x distance moved in direction of force
- Force = Pressure x area 
- Distance in this case is change in volume $\Delta V = A\Delta s$ 
>[!abstract] Isobaric work
>- Work done when a gas changes volume at constant pressure, $W = P\Delta V$

- **State of a gas** - Specified by quoting the pressure, P, T, V, n

# First law of Thermodynamics
