# Thermal energy, internal energy and heat
- **Internal Energy** of a substance is the sum of total random kinetic energies and total potential energies of all the particles inside it
	- The word random means that the particles movement are disorder and unpredictable
- **Thermal Energy** - the energy associated with heat and temperature. Thermal energy appears as a result of friction, air resistance, impacts, and other interactions between obects. 
- Thermal energy refers to the energy contained within a system that is responsible for its temperature. Heat is the flow of thermal energy. A whole branch of physics, thermodynamics, deals with how heat is transferred between different systems and how work is done in the process
	- Thermal energy is a measurement of the random kinetic energy of vibrating particles in an object
	- Variable $E_{int}$ Unit: $J$
## Kinetic theory of matter
- All matter is composed of a very large number of small particles that are in constant motion
### Solids, liquids and gases

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **arrangement of particles** | regular patterns                                                 | no pattern                                                     | no pattern                       |
| **Forces between particles** | attractive and large enough to keep particles in their positions | some partiles have enough energy to overcome attractive forces | negligible under most conditions |
| **Separation of particles**  | close together                                                   | still close together                                           | much further apart               |
| **Motion of particles**      | vibrate in fixed positions                                       | some limited random movement is possible                       | all move in random directions and usually with high speeds


### Density
$$density = \dfrac{mass}{volume}, \rho = \dfrac mV si $$
Si unit: $kgm^{-3}$

- When solids and liquids are heated to a higher temperature, they will usually **expand** s/ightly in size. 
- Gas will expanded only if they are in a container that will allow that to happen

# Temperature
## Macroscopic understanding of temperature

- **Temperature** - describes how hot or cold an object is and determines the direction of heat flow between two bodies
- The resultant flow o thermal energy is always from higher temperature to lower temperature
- objects with no net transfer of thermal energy then the they are in  **thermal equilibrium*
- Being in **thermal contact** means energy can be transferred between them, by any means

### Kelvin scale of temperature
- its widely used in science
- **absolute zero** which is $-273.15 ^\circ C$ is experssed as $0K$
- They go up the same way so:
- $K = 273.15 +^\circ C$
## Microscopic understanding of temperature 
- Molecules that have lower average kinetic energy will collide with molecules that have higher average kinetic energy. Lower average kinetic energy will speed up, and higher average kinetic energy will slow down to become equivalent. 
- Higher the temperature, higher the average particle speed of the same gas
- Temperature(K) is proportional to the average random translational kinetic energy, $E_k$ of particles in a gas
- Molecules have rotational kinetic energy, and **vibrational kinetic energy** 
>[!abstract] Equations
>Average random translational kinetic energy of a gas particle: 
>$\overline E = \dfrac 32 k_b T$
>$k_B$ is known as **boltzmann constant**. It has a value $1.38 \cdot 10^{-23}JK^{-1}$
>Kelvin Temperature - $T$

- A temperature rise is equivalent to the particles gaining kinetic energy
#### Boltzmann's constant
- How much energy(joule) of one gas molecule increases by every time temperature is increased by 1K
- $k_B = \dfrac nN R = \dfrac 1N_A R$
- $n$ - number of mole
- $N$ - number of molecules
- R - [[B.3 Gas laws#Universal gas constant]]
- $k_B$ is the microscopic equivalence of the [[B.3 Gas laws#Universal gas constant]] 
## Internal energy 
- All substances contain moving particles. 
- moving particles have kinetic energy. 
- There are three forms of kinetic energy:
	- **Vibrational kinetic energy** - vibrating about fixe positions
	- **translational kinetic energy in liquids and gases** - particles moving from place to place
	- **rotational kinetic energy** - Molecules might be rotating 
- Particles have potential energy as well as kinetic energy. 
- In solids and liquids, the electrical forces keeps them from moving apart or moving closer together. 
- If the average separation of the particles in a solid or liquid increases, so too does their potential energy(and the total internal energy of the substance)
- In gasses however, forces between molecules are usually negligible.
# Heat
- **Heat** - energy that is transferred from one body to another as resulf of a difference in temperature
- Energy transferred from a hot to a cold body by heating increases the internal energy of the cold body. 
- Work done on the particles of a substance increases potential energy of the particles, and so increases internal energy
# Thermal energy 
- Thermal energy is the transfer of energy because of a temperature difference
- There are three principal ways in which thermal energy can be transferred:
	- **Thermal conduction** - Kinetic energy is transferred between particles
	- **Convection** - differences in densities of liquids and gases result in their movement
	- **Thermal radiation** - electromagnetic radiation is emitted by surfaces 


## Thermal conduction
-  **Thermal conduction** - passage of thermal energy through a substance as energy is transferred from particle to particle 
- Thermal conduction occurs because of the transfer of kinetic energy between particles
- For solids, particles vibrate in fixed positions. Energy is transferred through the solid because of the forces / interactions between particles
- Solid are usually better thermal conductors because they of the closeness of the particles and the strength of forces between them. 
- **Insulator** materials significantly reduces the flow of thermal energy. 
### Quantitative treatment of thermal conductivity
>[!abstract] Rate of transfer of thermal energy by conduction:
>$\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = kA\dfrac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$
>Q = Thermal energy 
>t = time
>x = thickness
>$\Delta T = T_H - T_C$ = change in temperature
>k = **thermal conductivity**  of the substance
>A = area of contact

![[Pasted image 20231030082441.png]]
$\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ is the flow of energy per second = power which is measured in Watts
- Air is the best insulator but thermal energy can also be transferred by **convection currents**. Various kinds of foam consist mainly of air, but the foam limits the movement of that air. 
## Thermal Convection 
- **Thermal convection** - The transfer of thermal energy because of the movement of a fulid due to changes in density 
	- When a part o the fluid is heated, there will be localized dceares in density. Because of buoyancy, the warmer parts flow upwards. The movement of thermal energy in a fluid is thermal convection
- Fun fact: this is why radiators are close to the floor and air conditioners are high up
## Thermal radiation
- **Thermal radiation** - Emission of electromagnetic waves because of the movement of charges particles in the atoms of all matter at all temperatures. Mostly commonly, infrared. 
- **Infrared** - Electromagnetic radiation emitted by all objects with wavelengths longer than visible light. 

- Although it is true to say that thermal radiation is emitted continuously by all matter al all temperature, we tend to only notice it coming from hot objects. 
- The power of the emitted radiation from *any* surface depends on:
	1. Surface temperature: the radiated power is proportional to the fourth power of the surface temperature. $T^4$
	3. Surface area - Radiated power is proportional to the area, $A$
	4. Nature of the surface
	- *Note that emitted power is not dependent on the chemical nature of the material*
#### Good absorbers and good emitters of thermal radiation
- Dark surfaces, especially black is the best absorbers
- White and shiny surfaces reflect and scatter radiation well. 

>[!info] Thermal radiation
>Any surface which is good absorber of radiation will also be a good emitter


##### Black bodies
- Perfect **Black body** - term used to describe an object that has a surface which absorbs all of the infrared and light. 

	The total power, P, emitted from a perfect black body of surface area, A, can be calculate from the **stefan-Boltzmann law**: 
	Power emitted from a block body, $P = \sigma AT^4$   
	$\sigma$ is known as the **Stefan-Boltzmann constant**. It has the value of $5.67 \cdot 10^{-8} Wm^{-2} K^{-4}$
- when referring to celestial objects, the emitted power is usually called **luminosity**.

##### Wien's displacement law
There is a straightforward inverse relationship between surface temperature, T, and the wavelength at which the maximum power is received, 
$$T \propto \dfrac 1\lambda_{max}$$
$$\lambda_{max} T = 2.9 \cdot 10^{-3}mK$$
#### Thermal Radiation and Stars
**Luminosity** of a star, $L_{\odot} = \sigma AT^4$
- There is no conduction or convection across the near-vacuum of space and the starts can be considered a perfect black body. 
###### Apparent Brightness and intensity 
- Luminosity is its actual brightness and is different from what e detect on earth which is called a star's **apparent brightness**.
- **Apparent brightness** - a measure of **intensity** of the radiation from the star which reaches earth
>[!abstract] Intensity
>$$\text{intensity} = \dfrac{power}{area} \space I = \dfrac PA$$
>SI unit: $Wm^{-2}$

##### Determining astronomical distances
$b = \dfrac L{4\pi d^2}$ can be used to determine the distance, d, to any star if we measure its apparent brightness, b,, but only if we know its luminosity L.
# Heating and cooling
- The blue line shows the change in temperature when heated at a constant rate with no thermal energy loss. The red line shows the change in temperature with thermal energy loss. At some point, it will reach constant temperature when the unput power and the rate of thermal energy loss to the surroundings are equal . 
![[Pasted image 20231103140615.png | 300]]
- The rate at which thermal energy is transferred away decreases with time since it depends on the difference of temperature. 
![[Pasted image 20231103140640.png |300]]
## Specific heat capacity
- **specific heat capacity** of a substance is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1kg of the substance by 1K. SI Unit:$Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$
>[!abstract] Equation
>$$Q = mc\Delta T$$
>$Q$ = thermal energy supplied
>$m$ = mass
>$c$ = specific heat capacity
>$\Delta T$ = change in temperature

- The higher the specific heat capacity the slower it heats up. 
- It can be used to find how much thermal energy was transferred away when cooled down as well
## Thermal Capacity
- **Thermal capacity** - The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of a particular object by 1 K (different than specific heat capacity since its not only of one substance)
- Its the same equation
## Exchanges of thermal energy 
- If the system is insulated from its surroundings, the thermal energy given out by one object is equal to the thermal energy absorbed by the other object. 
- **Calorimetry** - experiments that try to accurately measure the temperature changes produced by various physical or chemical processes. 
	- calories is measured in Energy, J,
	- 1000 calories is the amount of energy needed to heat 1kg of water by 1K. 
	- 1cal = 4.184 J
## Changes of phase
- **Phase (of matter)** - a definite region of space in which all physical and chemical properties of the substance is the same. 
	- E.g. a bottle containing oil and water has different(chemical) phase of matter. A bottle containing ice and water has two different physical phases of matter.
- **states of matter** - Solid, Liquid, or gas(or plasma)

![[Pasted image 20231103140314.png | 300]]
- When there is a phase of matter, temperature stays constant. 
**latent heat** - instead of the energy going to heat, the energy is going to changing the phase of matter. (in a more official term: the heat or energy that is absorbed or released during a phase change of a substance)
### Boiling and Evaporation
- There will always be some molecules near the surface that have enough energy to overcome the attractive forces that hold 
- **Evaporation** occurs from surface of a liquid over a range of temperatures. Boiling occurs throughout a liquid at a precise temperature.  It can be changed according to pressure
-  **boiling** occurs at a precise temperature - temperature which the molecules have enough energy to form bubbles inside the liquid. 
- Evaporation leads to a decrease in average kinetic energy. That's why a fall temperatures always accompanies evaporation from a liquid. 
- 
## Latent heat
**Latent heat** - thermal energy that is transferred at constant temperature during any change of physical phase. 
- The specific latent heat of a substance, $L$, is the amount of energy transferred when 1 kg of the substance changes phase at a constant temperature. 
>[!abstract] Specific latent heat equation
>$$Q = mL$$ 
>SI units: $Jkg^{-1}$

- :Since there are two phase changes, each substance has twa latent heats. 
- Latent heat associated with freezing or melting is called **specific latent heat of fusion**, $L_f$ 
- Latent heat associated with boiling or condensing is known as **specific latent heat of vaporization**, $L_v$
