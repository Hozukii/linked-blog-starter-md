### Boyle's law
- states that equal pressure is inversely proportional to volume (when temperature is constant)
$$P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2$$
p = pressure of the gas
V = volume of the gas
Pressure is measured in, $Nm^{-2}$ or pascals (Pa)
One bar = 100 00 Pa
the standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101325 Pa, equivalent to 760mmHg

## Charles law 
- States that volume is proportional to temperature(when pressure is constant). *Temperature must be in kelvin*
$$\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{V_2}{T_2}$$
v - volume of gas 
T - temperature of gas



### Gay-Lussac's Law
- States that pressure is proportional to temperature (When volume is constant). Must be Kelvin
$$\dfrac{P_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2}{T_2}$$
p - pressure of gas
T - temperature of gas

## Combined Gas law
$$\dfrac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \dfrac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}$$
# Pressure and a gas
- Take any container and a any number gas molecules inside. Gas molecules are constantly changing in direction. Therefore it's always accelerating
- The force comes from the sides of the container
- The walls of the container experiences a force dependent on the number of times and velocity of a gas molecule that hits it. This is called "pressure"
## Some issues with the idea
- Gasses aren't really that consistent
- Therefore, we make an approximation
- For this... we have an **ideal gas**
- **Ideal gas** - imaginary gas that is used to model real gases, and has the following properties
	- identical perfect spheres
	- Perfectly elastic 
	- no intermolecular forces - potential energy does not change
	- so small that their volume is much smaller than the volume of their container
## Ideal gas law
$$PV = n RT$$
P = pressure - Pa
V = volume - $m^3$ 
n = amount of substance - number of moles
R = ideal gas constant - 8.31, ($Jk^{-1}mol^{-1}$)
T = temperature

# Introdcution to thermal nergy transfer
- Thermal energy is the internal energy present in a system due to t e motion of its particles
- Thermal energy can be transferred via three primary mechanisms
	- conduction
	- convection
	- thermal radiation
	
## Conduction
- Temperature is a measure of average kinetic energy
- Substance with a high temperature is able to give some of that energy to the particles next to it and so on 
- Only works in solid and thermal energy always moves from high energy to low energy 
## Convection
- Substance with a high temperature is able to give some of that energy to the particles next to it and so on.
- This only works in a liquids and gases as the higher kinetic energy particles are further apart (potential) and thus are lower in density meaning they move upwards.
## Radiation
- This has no real temperature 
- Radiation is the movement of electromagnetic waves through a vacuum
- this only works in a vacuum and wavelengths, such as those in infra red, could add energy to a substance and heat it up. 
## Thermal conduction
$$\dfrac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} = k \cdot A \cdot \dfrac{\Delta T}{\Delta x}$$
- $\Delta Q / \Delta t$: Rate of heat transfer(energy per unit time)
- k: thermal conductivity of the material(W/mk)
- A: cross-sectional area through which heat is being transferred
- $\Delta T$: Temperature difference across the material(in kelvin; K)
- $\Delta x$: thickness of the material(in metres, m)
-
