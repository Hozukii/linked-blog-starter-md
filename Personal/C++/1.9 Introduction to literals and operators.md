- **Literal** - fixed value that has been inserted directly into the source code
- Unlike a variable, the value of a literal is fixed and can't be changed
Look at this for example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << 5 << '\n'; // print the value of a literal

    int x { 5 };
    std::cout << x << '\n'; // print the value of a variable
    return 0;
}
```

- both output statements do the same thing (print the value 5). But in the case of the literal, the value `5` can be printed directly. In the case of the variable, the value `5` must be fetched from the memory the variable represents.
	- This is why a literal is constant while a variable can be changed
### Operators 
- **Operator** - process involving zero or more input value that produces a new value
- Take 2+3 equals 5
	- The literals 2 and 3 are the operands
	- `+` is operator 
- **Arity** - number of arguments or operands a function or operatker takes
- Unary - one operand (`-x,++x`)
- Binary - 2 operand (`x + y, x > y`)
- Ternary - three operands 
	- Only one of these in C++
- Nullary - act on zero operands 
	- also only one of these
### Chaining operators
- Used together such that the output of one operator can be used as input for another operator
	- `2 * 3 + 4`, Multiplication operator first, then addition next
### Return values and side effects
- operators in C++ just use their operands to calculate a return value
	- `-5` produces return value `-5`
	- `2+3` produces return value `5`
- Some operators have additional behaviours
	- **Side effect** - an operator that has some observable effect beyond producing a return value
	- `x = 5` has side effect of assigning value `5` to variable `x`
