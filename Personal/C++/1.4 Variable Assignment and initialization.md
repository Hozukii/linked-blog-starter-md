- **Assignment** - Giving a variable a value
```cpp
int width; // define an integer variable named width
width = 5; // assignment of value 5 into variable width
```

- $=$ is an assignment operator
- $==$ is a equality operator (compares values)
### Variable initialization
**initialize your value upon creation**
- Instead of defining a variable, and assigining a value you can initialize
- **Initialization** - process of specifying an initial value for an object
```cpp
    int width { 5 }; // Assign variable and value
    std::cout << width; // prints 5
```
#### Different forms of Initialization
- 5 Common types
```cpp
int a;         // default-initialization (no initializer)

// Traditional initialization forms:
int b = 5;     // copy-initialization (initial value after equals sign)
int c ( 6 );   // direct-initialization (initial value in parenthesis)

// Modern initialization forms (preferred):
int d { 7 };   // direct-list-initialization (initial value in braces)
int height = { 6 }; // copy-list-initialization (rarely used)
int e {};      // value-initialization (empty braces)
```

- **Default-initialization** - In many cases, performs no initialization can sometimes be unpredictable 
- **copy-initialization** - Not as efficient, but mostly fixed after C++ 17
- **Direct-initialization** - Has fallen out of favour but has some few use cases
- **List-initialization** - make use of curly braces, 
##### List-initialization disallows narrowing conversions
- If you try to list-initialize a variable using a value that the variable can not safely hold, the complier is required to produce a diagnostic to notify you. 
	- That's why it's good for beginners
- For example, if the data type is int, then when a fraction is put in the list, it will not work
- Only disallows to the list-initialization, not any subsequent assignments to the variable 
#### value-initialization and zero-initialization
- **value-initialization** - list-initialization using empty set of braces
	- In most cases it will implicitly initialize to the variable zero called **zero-initialization**
- Should be used when the value is temporary and will be replaced, if 0 will be used, direct-list initialize
### Instantiation
- **Instantiation** - variable has been created and initialized
- An instantiated object is sometimes called an instance
	- Most often, this term is applied to class type objects
### Initialization multiple variables
```cpp
int a = 5, b = 6;          // copy-initialization
int c ( 7 ), d ( 8 );      // direct-initialization
int e { 9 }, f { 10 };     // direct-list-initialization
int i {}, j {};            // value-initialization
```

- You can't initialize both variables using one initialization statement (however, the compiler might not complain):
``` cpp
int a, b = 5; //wrong
```
### Unused initialized variable warnings
- Modern compilers will typically warn if variable in initialized but not used
- If "treat warning as error" is on, then it will error
- To fix it: 
	- Remove the variable
	- Us it somewhere
	- Use the `[[maybe_unused]]` attribute 
		- C++17 
		- likely not performance impact

``` cpp
    [[maybe_unused]] double pi { 3.14159 };  // Don't complain if unused
    [[maybe_unused]] double gravity { 9.8 }; 
```
