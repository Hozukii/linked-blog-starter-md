- **iostream** - input/output library
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
```

#### `Std::cout`
- send data to console
``` cpp
	std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
```
- `<<` **insertion operator** 
- It can also be used to print multiple in singe line
- `std::endl` - allows te output onto a new line
``` cpp
   std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; 
   // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line
    std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;
```
- It's best to output a new line whenever a output is complete even when it's not technically necessary
##### `std::cout` is buffered
- Output is first stored in memory (a buffer) before being actually sent to the console
- Periodically, the buffer is flush, meaning all the data collected is transferred to its destination
##### `std::endl` vs `\n`
- Using `std::endl` is often inefficient because it does two jobs
	- outputs newline, and flushes the buffer (which is slow)
- We typically don't need to flush the buffer ourselves. C++ does it periodically
- `\n` is used to output newline without flushing
- Don't need `\n` after a user input because they press enter to register
```cpp
    std::cout << "x is equal to: " << x << '\n'; 
    // single quoted (by itself) (conventional)
    std::cout << "Yep." << "\n";                 
    // double quoted (by itself) (unconventional but okay)
    std::cout << "And that's all, folks!\n";     
    // between double quotes in existing text (conventional)
```
#### `std::cin`
- `std::cin` - reads input from keyboard
- Used with the extraction operation `>>`
- `>>` **extraction operator** - used to put input data in a variable
``` cpp
int x{};
std::cin >> x; //get number from keyboard and store it in variable x
```

##### `std::cin` is buffered
- `std::cin` is buffered because it allows us to separate the entering of input from the extract and input. We can enter input once and then perform multiple extraction requests on it
- Meaning you can: enter  input value 4, press enter, then input value 5
	- Or: input 4 5, and it will take the value 4 for x and take the value 5 for y
#### Basic extraction process
how the `>>` operator works for input
1. If `std::cin` is not in a good state (e.g prior extraction failed and `std::cin` has not yet been cleared), no extraction is attempted
2. Leading whitespace characters are discarded from the niput buffer. This will discard an unextracted newline character remaining from a prior line of input
3. If the input buffer is now empty, extraction operator will wait for the user to enter more data . 
4. The extraction operator then extract as many consecutive characters as it can, until it encounters either a newline character or a character that is not valid for the variable being extracted to.
