- The syntax of the language requires some elements to be separated by white spaces
- Occurs mostly when two keywords or identifiers are placed consecutively
- Compilers does not care how much whitespaces is used
``` cpp
int x; // int and x separated
int           x;
```

- Preprocessor directives must be placed on separate lines:
- **Preprocessor directives** - Instruction that are processed before the actual compilation of your code begins (e.g `#include`)
	- All starts with `#` symbol
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
```

- Newlines are not allowed in quoted text
### Basic formatting
- C++ does not enforce any kind of formatting restrictions on the programmer. 
	- It is a whitespace-independent language
- Each statemen within curly braces should start one tab in:
``` cpp
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Hello world!\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
    std::cout << "Nice to meet you.\n"; // tabbed in one tab (4 spaces)
}
```

- Lines should not be too long
	- If a line is going to be long, split it into multiples lines
	- Consider keeping it 80 chars or less
- If a line is long, operator(eg. `<<` or `+`) should be placed at the beginning of the next line not the end of the current line
- Use whitespaces to align values or comments
```cpp
cost = 57;
pricePerItem = 24;
value = 5;
numberOfItems = 17;
```

```cpp
cost          = 57;
pricePerItem  = 24;
value         = 5;
numberOfItems = 17;
```
