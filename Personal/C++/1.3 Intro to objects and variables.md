- **Value** - single piece of data (data value)
- Common examples:
	- Numbers (e.g $5$ ,-6.7$)
	- Characters, which are placed between single quotes ($'H'$ or $' \text{\$}'$
	- Text, placed between double quotes (e.g. $\text{"Hello"}$)
		- Text can contain 0 or more characters
- **Literals** - Values placed directly into the source code
#### Random Access Memory
- Any data that is hardcoded into the program itself is loaded to the ram
- Operating systems have reserve ram when running programs
	- Common uses are to store values entered by the user
	- Store data read in from a file or network
	- store values calculated while the program is running
#### objects and variables
- Memory is accessed indirectly through an object
- **Object** - Represents a region of storage (typically RAM or a CPU register) that can hold a value 
	- objects also have associated properties
- While objects in C++ can be unnamed, we often name our objects using an identifier.
- **Variable** - An object with a name
	- Allowing to be referred later in the program
- **Definition** - Definition statement can be used to tell the complier that we want to use a variable in our program
- **Identifier** - the name that a variable is accessed by
- 
##### Variable creation
- At runtime (when the program is loaded into memory and run) each object is given an actual storage location that it can use to store values
- **Allocation** - The process of reserving storage for an object's use
#### Data types
- **Data types (type)** - Determines what kind of value the object will store
- The type of an object must be known at compile-time, thus can't be changed without compiling
- C++ allows you to create your own custom types
#### Defining multiple variables
- It's possible to define multiple variables with comma. 
```cpp 
int a;
int b;
```
More efficient would be:
```cpp
int a,b;
```
Common mistakes:
``` cpp
int a, int b; // defining variables in sequence
int a, double b; 
// defining different variables in the same statement
```
