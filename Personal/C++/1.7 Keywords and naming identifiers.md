### Identifier naming rules
- Cannot be a keyword, they are reserved
- only be composed of letters, numbers, and the underscore character
	- no symbols or spaces
- must begin with a letter or underscore 
	- no numbers
- C++ is case sensitive, there IS a different between upper and lower case letters
#### Identifier naming best practices
- Should start with a lower case 
- Intercapped(Upper case) or underscores when a identifier is a multi-word
- Best to use the conventions already existing within whatever you're working on
- Good naming should be:
	- Easily be distinguished from other identifiers
	- The name should tell you what it is used for
	- Think about the people reading your code
