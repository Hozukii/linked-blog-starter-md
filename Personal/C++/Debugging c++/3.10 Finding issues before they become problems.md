### Don't make errors
- List of things that can help avoid making errors:
	- Follow best practice
	- Don't program when tired or frustrated
	- Understand where the common pitfalls are in a language
	- Don't let your functions get too long
	- Prefer using the standard library to writing your own code when possible
	- Comment your code liberally
	- Start with simple solutions, then layer in complexity incrementally
	- Avoid clever / non-obvious solutions
	- Optimize for readability
### Refactoring your code
- When adding new capabilities to your code, it gets longer, and it's gets more complicated
- **refactoring** - you can break a single long function into multiple shorter functions without changing the behaviour of the code
	- This makes your program less complex by increasing its organization
- Function that takes one vertical screen worth of code is generally regarded as tool long
- Remember goal is to maximize comprehension and maintainability, not to minimize function length
### Intro to defensive programming
- Errors can also occur when users use the program in a way you did not anticipate
	- e.g. it asks a user to enter a integer , and they enter a letter instead.
- **Defensive programming** - practice whereby the programmer tries to anticipate all of they ways the software could be misused.
### Finding errors fast
- Since not making errors is difficult, best next thing is to catch errors you do make quickly
#### Intro testing functions
- One common way to help uncover issues to "exercise the code" 
#### Intro to constraints
- Constraint-based techniques involve the addition of some extra code to check that some set of assumption or expectations are not violated
	- e.g., if we were to calculate athe factorial of a number, which expects a non-negative argument, the function could check if it's a non-negative number before proceeding it. 
#### Shotgunning for general issues
- Programmers tend to amke certains kinds of common mistakes
- **static analysis tools** - programs that analyze your source code to identify specific semantic issues
	- e.g. compiler
