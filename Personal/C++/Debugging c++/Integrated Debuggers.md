- Previously, we've assumed that the code will run to completion or the debugging methods will not work
- Modern IDEs come with integrated tool called a debugger so the code itself doesn't need to complete to debug
# Stepping
- **debugger** - Program that allows the programmer to control how another program executes and examines the program while running
- **Stepping** - Set of related debugger features that let us execute our code statement by statement
### Step into and step over 
- **Step into** - Command that executes the next statement in the normal execution path of the program, the pauses execution to examine the program's state using the debugger
- **step over** - similar to step into but when a function is called, it executes the whole function at once whereas step into executes lines of the called function one by one
- Consider:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
void printValue(int value)
{
	std::cout << value << '\n';
}
int main()
{
	printValue(5)
	return 0;
}
```

- With step into, when `printValue` is called, the debugger will check every line in the `printValue` function
- With step over, when `printValue` is called, the debugger will simply execute the function
- Note that step into will step into anything, in this case, the debugger will step into the function `std::cout`
#### Run to cursor
- Â command executes the program until execution reaches the statement selected by your cursor.
- In VS code, choose a break point, debug, right click and run to cursor
#### Continue 
- **Continue** - debug command that simply continues running either until the program terminates or something triggers control to return back to you.
#### Start
- Just like continue but it does that from the start of the program
	- It can only be invoked when not already in a debug session
#### Breakpoints
- **Breakpoints** - special marker that tells the debugger to stop execution of the program at the breakpoint when running in debug mode
# Watching variables
- **watching variable** - process of inspecting the value of a variable while the program is executing in debug mode
