### Expressions
- **Expression** - non-empty sequence of literals, variables, and operators, and function calls that calculates a value
- **Evaluation** - processing of executing an expression, the value produced is the **result**
```cpp
2               // 2 is a literal that evaluates to value 2
"Hello world!"  // "Hello world!" is a literal that evaluates to text "Hello world!"
x               // x is a variable that evaluates to the value held by variable x
2 + 3           // operator+ uses operands 2 and 3 to evaluate to value 5
five()          // evaluates to the return value of function five()
```

- Literals evaluate their own value
- Expressions do not end in a semi colon, and cannot be compiled by themselves 
	- `x = 5`
	- It has to be:
```cpp
int x{ 2 + 3 }; // 2 + 3 is an expression that has no semicolon -- the semicolon is at the end of the statement containing the expression
```

### Expression statements
- Certain expressions (such as `x = 5`) are used primarily for their side effects 
- Since they cannot be executed themselves, you convert any expression into an equivalent statement
- **Expression statement** - statement that consists of an expression followed by a semi colon. 
- Thus we can take any expression (such as `x = 5`) asd turn it into an expression statement (`x = 5;` ) that will compile
- When a expression is used in a expression statement, any result generated by the expression is discarded
### Useless expression statements
- we can also make expression statement that compile but have no side effect, 
	- For example `2 * 3;` is an expression statemetn whose expression evaluates to the result value 6, which is then discarded. thus such expression statement is useless
### Subexpressions, full expressions, and compound expressions 
``` cpp
2         // literal that evaluates value 2
2 + 3     // uses operator+ to evaluate value 5
x = 4 +5  // evaluates value 9, which is assigned to valiable x
```

- **Subexpression** - expression used as an operand.
	- e.g. subexpression of `x = 4 + 5` are `x` and `4 + 5`
	- subexpression of `4 +5` are `4` and `5`
- **Full expression** - expression that are not a subexpression
- **Compound expression** - expression that contains two or more uses of operators 
	- e.g. `x = 4 + 5`
