- Uninitialized - variable that has no been given a value
- Being not initialized does not mean that it's uninitialized
- Variable that is not initialized will be given a random value that has been previously stored in the memory
- so it's random
### Undefined behaviour
- Occurs when executing code that has not been well defined
- Not initializing a variable can lead to:
	- Your program produces different results every time it is run.
	- Your program consistently produces the same incorrect result.
	- Your program behaves inconsistently (sometimes produces the correct result, sometimes not).
	- Your program seems like itâ€™s working but produces incorrect results later in the program.
	- Your program crashes, either immediately or later.
	- Your program works on some compilers but not others.
	- Your program works until you change some other seemingly unrelated code
### Implementation-defined behaviour and unspecified behaviour
- **Implementation** - It's used to determine some aspect of the language will behave
	- comes in specific compilers and the associated standard library
- **implementation-defined behaviour** - behaviour that is defined by the implementation.
