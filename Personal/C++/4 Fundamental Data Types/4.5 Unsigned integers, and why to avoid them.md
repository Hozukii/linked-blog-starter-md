### Unsigned integers 
- **Unsigned integers** - integers that can only hold non-negative whole numbers
### Defining unsigned integers
- You use the `unsigned` keyword
``` cpp
unsigned short us;
unsigned int ui;
unsigned long ul;
unsigned long long ull;
```
### Unsigned integer range
- 1-byte unsigned integer has a range from 0 to 255
- an n-bit unsigned variable has a range of 0 to $2^n -1$
- Unsigned integers are useful for networking and systems with little memory, when negative number as not required.
- Unsigned integer overflow
