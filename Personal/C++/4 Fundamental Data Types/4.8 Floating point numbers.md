- **Floating point** type variable - variable that can hold a number with a fractional component
	- Floating data types are always signed
### C++ floating point types
- C++ has 3 fundamental floating point types
	- Single-precision `float`
	- a double-precision `double`
	- extended-precision `long double`
- As with integers, C++ does not define the actual size of these types
