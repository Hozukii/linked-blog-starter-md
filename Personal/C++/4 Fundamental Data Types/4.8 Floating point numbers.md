- **Floating point** type variable - variable that can hold a number with a fractional component
	- Floating data types are always signed
### C++ floating point types
- C++ has 3 fundamental floating point types
	- Single-precision `float`
	- a double-precision `double`
	- extended-precision `long double`
- As with integers, C++ does not define the actual size of these types

| Category       | C++ type    | Typical Size       |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Floating point | float       | 4 bytes            |
|                | double      | 8 bytes            |
|                | long double | 8, 12, or 16 bytes |

- As floating-point types are conventionally implemnted using one of the floating-point formats defined in the [[IEEE 754 standard]], `float` and `double` are always almost 4 and 8 bytes respectively
- `long double` does not comply with IEEE 754. 
	- thus it can vary
	- avoid if possible
### Floating point variables and literals
```cpp
int a { 5 };      // 5 means integer
double b { 5.0 }; // 5.0 is a floating point literal (no suffix means double type by default)
float c { 5.0f }; // 5.0 is a floating point literal, f suffix means float type

int d { 0 };      // 0 is an integer
double e { 0.0 }; // 0.0 is a double
```

- An `f` suffix is used to denote a literal of type float 
### Floating point numbers
Consider: 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 5.0 << '\n';
	std::cout << 6.7f << '\n';
	std::cout << 9876543.21 << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```

The result is:
```
5
6.7
9.87654e+06
```

- In the first case, result is 5 because `std::cout` will not print the fractional part if it's 0
- Second is expected
- In the third case, it printed as a scientific notation

### Floating point precision
- The precision of a floating point type defines how many significant digits it can represent without information loss
- The number of digits of precision of a floating type depends on:
	- size (floats have less precision than doubles)
	- particular value being stored
