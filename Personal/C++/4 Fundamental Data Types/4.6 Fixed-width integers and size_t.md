### Why isn't integer types size fixed?
- It due to the early days of C when performance was the utmost concern
	- It let the compiler implementers pick the size of `int` that perform the best on the target computer architecture
- By modern standards, the lack of consistent ranges for the various integral types sucks
### Fixed-width integers
- To address the issue, C++11 implemented set of integer types with same size on any architecture called **fixed-width integers**
- The fixed-width integers are defined (in the `<cstdint>\` header) as follows:

Example:
```cpp
#include <cstdint> // for fixed-width integers
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::int32_t x { 32767 }; // x is always a 32-bit integer
    x = x + 1;                // so 32768 will always fit
    std::cout << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

- Use fixed-width integer type when you need an integral type with guaranteed range
#### Warning: `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8St` typically behave like chars
- Due to an oversight in the C++ specifications, `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8St` area treated the same as `signed char` and `unsigned char` respectively
