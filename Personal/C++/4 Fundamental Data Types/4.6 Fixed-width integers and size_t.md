### Why isn't integer types size fixed?
- It due to the early days of C when performance was the utmost concern
	- It let the compiler implementers pick the size of `int` that perform the best on the target computer architecture
- By modern standards, the lack of consistent ranges for the various integral types sucks
### Fixed-width integers
- To address the issue, C++11 implemented set of integer types with same size on any architecture called **fixed-width integers**
- The fixed-width integers are defined (in the `<cstdint>\` header) as follows:
![[Pasted image 20250625150539.png]]

Example:
```cpp
#include <cstdint> // for fixed-width integers
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::int32_t x { 32767 }; // x is always a 32-bit integer
    x = x + 1;                // so 32768 will always fit
    std::cout << x << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

- Use fixed-width integer type when you need an integral type with guaranteed range
#### Warning: `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8St` typically behave like chars
- Due to an oversight in the C++ specifications, `std::int8_t` and `std::uint8St` area treated the same as `signed char` and `unsigned char` respectively

#### Other fixed-width downsides
- Fixed-width integers are not guaranteed to be defined on all architectures
	- It shouldn't be a problem in almost all modern architectures
- Fixed-width integer may be slower than a wider type on some architectures
	- The architecture might be faster at processing certain bits over others but programs are often constrained by memory usage rather than CPU so not a big issue
#### Fast and least integral types
- To address the downsides C++ has alternative sets of integers.
##### Fast integral types
- The fast types provide the fastest signed/unsigned type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64)
	- syntax: `std::int_fast#_t` and `std::uint_fast#_t`
	- e.g. `std::int_fast32_t`
- Fast meaning most quickly processed by the CPU.
##### Least integral types
- least types provided the smallest signed/unsigned type with a width of at least # bits (where # = 8, 16, 32, or 64)
	- syntax: `std::int_least#_t` and `std::uint_least#_t`
	- e.g. `std::int_least32_t`
- Avoid the fast and least integral types because they may exhibit different behaviors on architectures where they resolve to different sizes.
### Best practices for integral types
- Since there's so many types and each has their pros and cons, there is little consensus
- It's better to be correct than fast so avoid fast/least types in favour of the fixed-width types.
- Prefer `int` when size doesn't matter
- prefer `std::int#_t` when storing a quantity with guaranteed range
- Prefer `std::uint#_t` when doing bit manipulation or well-defined wrap-around behaviour is required
Avoid:
- `short` and `long` integers (used fixed instead)
- The fast and least integral types
- Unsigned types for holding quantities
- 8-bit fixed-width integer types
- Any compiler-specific fixed-width integers
#### What is std::size_t
Consider:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << sizeof(int) << '\n';
	return 0
}
```
