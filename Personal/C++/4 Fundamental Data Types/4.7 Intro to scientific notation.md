Scientific notation has the form:
$$ \text{significand} \cdot 10^{\text{exponent}}$$
- It can be hard to display exponents so often `e` is used 
	- e.g. $1.2 \cdot 10 ^4$ is `1.2e4`
### Significant digits
- When converting to scientific notation, trailing zeros after a decimal point are considered significant so we keep them. 
	- 87.0 g = 8.70e1
	- 87.000g = 8.7000e1
