### Bits, bytes, and memory addressing
- In [[1.3 Intro to objects and variables]] we said: **variables** are names for a piece of memory that an be used to store information
- **binary digit (bit)** - smallest unit of memory
	- 0 is off, 1 is on
- Memory is organized into sequential units called **memory addresses**
	- Allows us to find and access to the contents of memory at a particular location
- In modern computers, each bit does not get its own unique memory address as number of memory addresses is limited and the need to accesses bit by bit is rare
- Instead each memory address holds 1 byte of data
- **byte** - group of bits that are operated on as a unit.
	- Modern standard is 8 sequential bits

### Data types
- **Data types** - it tells the compiler how to interpret the contents of memory in some meaningful way
	- e.g. integer
- When objects is given a value, the compiler and CPU take care of encoding your value into appropriate sequence of bits for that data type which is stored in your memory
#### Fundamental data types
- **Fundamental data types ( basic types, primitive types)** - most basic types.
List of Fundamental data type:

| Types                                                                      | Category             | Meaning                                          | Example |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |

| bool                                                                       | integral (boolean)   | true or false                                    | true    |

| short int<br>int<br>long int<br>long long int (C++11)                      | integral (integer)   | positive and negative whole numbers, including 0 | 64      |
| std::nullptr_t (C++11)                                                     | null pointer         | a null pointer                                   | nullptr |
| void                                                                       | void                 | no type                                          | n/a     |

#### Integer vs integral types
- Integral in the context of C++ is used to mean "like an integer"
- C++ standard defines the following terms:
	- **standard integer type** - `short`, `int`,`long`,`long long`
	- **integral types** - `bool`, the various char types, and the standard integer types
- All integral types are stored in memory as integer values, but only the standard integer types will dislay as an integer value when output
- The term "integral types" only includes fundamental types.
	- non-fundamental types (e.g. `enum`) are not integral types even when they are stored as an integer
#### Other sets of types
- C++ contains three sets of types
- First two are built in (does not require the inclusion of a header to use):
	- "Fundamental data types" provides the most the basic and essential data types
	- "Compound data types" provide more complex data types and allow for the creation of custom types
		- [[12.1 - into to compound data types]]
- Third set of types is provided by the C++ standard library
- It's best to avoid the term "bult-in type" as the term is not well defined. Could mean just fundamental data types or both fundamental and compound
- Data types to handle **strings** are part of the standard library in modern C++
#### The `_t` suffix
- `_t` suffix means type
	- common nomenclature applied to modern types
