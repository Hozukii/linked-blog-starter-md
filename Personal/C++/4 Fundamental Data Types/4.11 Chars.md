- **char** - Data types designed to hold a single `character`
	- **character** - single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace
- Char data type is integral type
	- underlying value is stored as an integer
- integer stored by a `char` variable are interpreted as an `ASCII character`
	- [[ASCII]]
- Codes 0-31 and 127 are called unprintable chars. 
	- Designed to control peripheral devices such as printers
	- Most are obsolete
- Codes 32-126 are called printable characters
- If you try to print something outside the range of ASCII, the results are dependent upon your OS
### Initializing chars
- You can initialize char variables using character literals
``` cpp
char ch2{'a'}; // initialize with code point for 'a' (97) (preferred)
char ch1{97}; // not preferred
```

- Be careful not to mix character numbers with integer numbers
	- `5` and `'5'` are not the same
### Printing chars
- When using `std::cout`, it prints a char variable as an ASCII character
``` cpp
    char ch1{ 'a' }; // (preferred)
    std::cout << ch1; // cout prints character 'a'
```

### Inputting chars
- `std::cin` will let you enter multiple characters. However, `char` can only hold 1 character
- Only the first input character is extracted. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: "; // assume the user enters "abcd" (without quotes)
    char ch{};
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'a', "bcd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    // Note: The following cin doesn't ask the user for input, it grabs queued input!
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'b', "cd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
This returns
```
Input a keyboard character: a b
You entered: a
You entered: b
```

### Extracting whitespace characters
- Extracting input ignores leading whitespaces, this can lead to unexpected results whin trying to extract whitespace characters to a char variable:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: "; // assume the user enters "a b" (without quotes)
    char ch{};
    std::cin.get(ch); // extracts a, leaves " b\n" in stream
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    std::cin.get(ch); // extracts space, leaves "b\n" in stream
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
this returns :
```
Input a keyboard character: a b
You entered: a
You entered:  
```
