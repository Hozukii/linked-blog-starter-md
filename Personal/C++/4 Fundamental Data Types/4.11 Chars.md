- **char** - Data types designed to hold a single `character`
	- **character** - single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace
- Char data type is integral type
	- underlying value is stored as an integer
- integer stored by a `char` variable are interpreted as an `ASCII character`
	- [[ASCII]]
- Codes 0-31 and 127 are called unprintable chars. 
	- Designed to control peripheral devices such as printers
	- Most are obsolete
- Codes 32-126 are called printable characters
- If you try to print something outside the range of ASCII, the results are dependent upon your OS
### Initializing chars
- You can initialize char variables using character literals
``` cpp
char ch2{'a'}; // initialize with code point for 'a' (97) (preferred)
char ch1{97}; // not preferred
```

- Be careful not to mix character numbers with integer numbers
	- `5` and `'5'` are not the same
### Printing chars
- When using `std::cout`, it prints a char variable as an ASCII character
``` cpp
    char ch1{ 'a' }; // (preferred)
    std::cout << ch1; // cout prints character 'a'
```

### Inputting chars
- `std::cin` will let you enter multiple characters. However, `char` can only hold 1 character
- Only the first input character is extracted. 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: "; // assume the user enters "abcd" (without quotes)
    char ch{};
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'a', "bcd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    // Note: The following cin doesn't ask the user for input, it grabs queued input!
    std::cin >> ch; // ch = 'b', "cd" is left queued.
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
This returns
```
Input a keyboard character: a b
You entered: a
You entered: b
```

### Extracting whitespace characters
- Extracting input ignores leading whitespaces, this can lead to unexpected results whin trying to extract whitespace characters to a char variable:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "Input a keyboard character: "; // assume the user enters "a b" (without quotes)
    char ch{};
    std::cin.get(ch); // extracts a, leaves " b\n" in stream
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    std::cin.get(ch); // extracts space, leaves "b\n" in stream
    std::cout << "You entered: " << ch << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
this returns :
```
Input a keyboard character: a b
You entered: a
You entered:  
```
### Char size, range, and default sign
 - Char is defined by C++ to always be 1 byte in size
- may be signed or unsigned by default
- If you're using chars to hold ASCII characters, you don't need to specify sign
- Always specify whether it is signed or unsigned to hold small integers
	- (Something you should not do unless you're explicitly optimizing for space)
- A signed char can hold a number between -128 and 127
- Unsigned can hold 0 to 255
### Escape sequences
- **Escape sequences** - characters in C++ that have special meaning.
	- starts with a '\' character, and then a following letter or number
- Most common is `'\n'`
- Another commonly used escape sequence is `'\t'` which embeds a horizontal tab
``` cpp
    std::cout << "First part\tSecond part";
```
Output:
```
First part    Second part
```

- `\'` prints a single quote
- `\"` prints a double quote
- `\\` prints a backslash

#### Difference between putting symbols in singe and double quotes
- Text between single quotes is treated as `char`
- Text between double quotes are treated as a C-style string literal
	- [[5.2 Literals]]
- Best to use single quotes for `char`
#### Avoid multicharacter literals
- For backwards compatibility reasons, many C++ compliers support multicharacter literals but avoid it as they are not part of the C++ standard and thus not strictly defined
	- e.g. `'56'`
#### What about other char types, `wchar_t`, `char8_t`, `char16_t` and `char32_t`?
- Like [[ASCII]] other encoding standards exists. 
	- Most well known beside from ASCII is Unicode 
		- contains 144,000 integers
		- Many different languages
- You won't need to use `char8_t`, `char16_t`, or `char32_t` unless you're planning to make your program Unicode compatible
- `wchar_t` should be avoided in almost all cases
