- **char** - Data types designed to hold a single `character`
	- **character** - single letter, number, symbol, or whitespace
- Char data type is integral type
	- underlying value is stored as an integer
- integer stored by a `char` variable are interpreted as an `ASCII character`
	- [[ASCII]]
- Codes 0-31 and 127 are called unprintable chars. 
	- Designed to control peripheral devices such as printers
	- Most are obsolete
- Codes 32-126 are called printable characters
- If you try to print something outside the range of ASCII, the results are dependent upon your OS
### Initializing chars
- You can initialize char variables using character literals
``` cpp
char ch2{'a'}; // initialize with code point for 'a' (97) (preferred)
char ch1{97}; // not preferred
```

- Be careful not to mix character numbers with integer numbers
	- `5` and `'5'` are not the same
### Printing chars
- When using `std::cout`, it prints a char variable as an ASCII character
``` cpp
    char ch1{ 'a' }; // (preferred)
    std::cout << ch1; // cout prints character 'a'
```
