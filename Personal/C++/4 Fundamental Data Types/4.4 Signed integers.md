- **integer** - $\mathbb{Z}$
- C++ has 4 primary fundamental integer types

| Type          | Min size | Note                                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| short int     | 16 bits  |                                           |
| int           | 16 bits  | typically 32 bits on modern architectures |
| long int      | 32 bits  |                                           |
| long long int | 64 bits  |                                           |
- The key difference is their size, larger integers can hold bigger numbers
- Technically `bool` and `char` are also considered to be integral types but we'll exclude them for now
### Signed integers
- **sign** - the number's attribute of positive, negative, or zero
- By default integers in C++ are signed
### Defining signed integers
- The preferred way to define the four types of signed integers:
```cpp
short s; // prefer "short" over "short int"
int i;
long l; //prefer "long" over "long int"
long long ll; // prefer "long long" over "long long int"
```

It can optionally take a `signed` keyword which by convention is typically placed before the type name
e.g:
```cpp
signed short ss;
```

- But it's redundant as integers are signed by default
### Signed integer ranges
- **range** - the set of specific values that a data type can hold
- The range is determined by two factors
	- its size
	- whether it is signed or not

| Size / Type   | Range             |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| 8-bit signed  | -128 to 127       |
| 16-bit signed | -32 768 to 32 767 |
- n-bit signed variable has a range of $-(2^{n-1})$ to $(2^{n-1})-1$
### Overflow
- If we try to assign 140 to a 8 bit integer,
	- The C++20 standard makes this blanket statement: "If during the evaluation of an expression, the result is not mathematically defined or not in the range of representable values for its type, the behaviour is undefined" meaning **overflow**
- **integer overflow** - when an arithmetic operation (such as addition or multiplication) create a value outside the range.
### Integer division
- When dividing two integers, C++ works like you'd expect when the quotient is a whole number. 
- But when it is a fraction:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << 8 / 5 << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
- This produces an possibly unexpected result
- In this case it produces 1 as the real value is 1.6 and the fractional part is dropped
- Be careful when using integer division, but it's safe to use it as the results are predictable.
