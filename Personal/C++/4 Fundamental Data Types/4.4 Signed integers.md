- **integer** - $\mathbb{Z}$
- C++ has 4 primary fundamental integer types

| Type          | Min size | Note                                      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| short int     | 16 bits  |                                           |
| int           | 16 bits  | typically 32 bits on modern architectures |
| long int      | 32 bits  |                                           |
| long long int | 64 bits  |                                           |
- The key difference is their size, larger integers can hold bigger numbers
- Technically `bool` and `char` are also considered to be integral types but we'll exclude them for now
### Signed integers
- **sign** - the number's attribute of positive, negative, or zero
- By default integers in C++ are signed
### Defining signed integers
- The preferred way to define the four types of signed integers:
```cpp
short s; // prefer "short" over "short int"
int i;
long l; //prefer "long" over "long int"
long long ll; // prefer "long long" over "long long int"
```

It can optionally take a `signed` keyword which by convention is typically placed before the type name
e.g:
```cpp
signed short ss;
```

- But it's redundant as integers are signed by default
