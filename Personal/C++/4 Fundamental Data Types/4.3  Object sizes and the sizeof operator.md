### Object sizes
- Most objects actually take up more than 1 byte of memory
	- Single object may use 1,2,4,8, or even more consecutive memory addresses
	- It depends on its data type
- Usually we don't need to know as the compiler is able to do the process for us
- But there are reasons to know how much memory an object uses.
- First, the more memory an object uses, the more information it can hold
- A single bit can hold 2 possible values, 0 or 1 
- 2 bits can hold 4 possible values

| bit 0 | bit 1 |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     |

- 3 bits can hold 8 possible values
- To generalize $n$ bits can hold $2^n$ unique values
- Thus, size of objects puts a limit on the amount of unique values it can store
- Second, computers have finite amount of free memory
	- Since modern computers have a lot of memory ,the impact is usually negligible
	- But for some programs, the difference between using 1 byte and 8 byte objects can be significant
#### Fundamental data type sizes
- Surprisingly, the C++ standard does not define the exact size of any of the fundamental types
- Instead, the standard says the following
	- An object must occupy at least 1 byte (to have a distinct memory address)
	- A byte must be at least 8 bits
	- The integral types `char`, `short`, `int`, `long`,`long long`, have minimum size of 8, 16, 16, 32 and 64 bits respectively
	- `char` and `char8_t` are exactly 1 byte
- In this series, it's simplified by making reasonable assumptions for modern computers:
	- A byte is 8 bits
	- Memory is byte addressable
	- Floating point support is EEE-754 compliant
	- We are on a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture
- With these assumptions we can state the following:

| Category       | Type           | Min size         | Typical size      |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- |
| Boolean        | bool           | 1 byte           | 1 byte`           |
| Character      | char           | 1 byte (exactly) | 1 byte            |
|                | wchar_t        | 1 byte           | 2 or 4 bytes      |
|                | char8_t        | 1 byte           | 1 byte            |
|                | char16_t       | 2 bytes          | 2 bytes           |
|                | char32_t       | 4 bytes          | 4 bytes           |
| integral       | short          | 2 bytes          | 2 bytes           |
|                | int            | 2 bytes          | 4 bytes           |
|                | long           | 4 bytes          | 4 or 8 bytes      |
|                | long long      | 8 bytes          | 8 bytes           |
| Floating point | float          | 4 bytes          | 4 bytes           |
|                | double         | 8 bytes          | 8 bytes           |
|                | long double    | 8 bytes          | 8,12, or 16 bytes |
| point          | std::nullptr_t | 4 bytes          | 4 or 8 bytes      |
#### The `sizeof` operator
- **sizeof operator** - unary operator that take either a type of a variable, and returns the size of an object of that type. 
Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int x{};
    std::cout << "x is " << sizeof(x) << " bytes\n";
    return 0;
}
```
