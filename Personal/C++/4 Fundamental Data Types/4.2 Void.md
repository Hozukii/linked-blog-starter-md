- It's an **incomplete type**
	- **incomplete type** - type that has been declared but not yet defined
- Compiler knows the existence of such types but does not have enough info to determine how much memory to allocate.
- Incomplete types con not be instantiated
```cpp
void value; // won't work, variables can't be defined with incomplete type void
```
### Functions that don to return a value
- Most commonly, void is used to indicate that function does not return value
```cpp
void writeValue(int x) // void here means no return value
{
    std::cout << "The value of x is: " << x << '\n';
    // no return statement, because this function doesn't return a value
}
```

### Deprecated: Functions that don't take parameters
- In C void is used as a way to indicate that function does not take parameters
```cpp
int getValue(void) // void here means no parameters
{
    int x{};
    std::cin >> x;
    return x;
}
```

- In C++ `int getValue()` is enough as parameters is an implicit void
	- Use this instead
### Other uses of void
