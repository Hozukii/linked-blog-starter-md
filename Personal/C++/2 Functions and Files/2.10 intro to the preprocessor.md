 - Prior to compilation, each code file goes through **preprocessing**
- A program called the **preprocessor** makes various changes to the text of the code file which either happen in either temporarily in-memory or using temporary files 
- **translation unit** - The result after the preprocessor has finished processing
### Preprocessor directives
- **Preprocessor directives** - instructions that start with a `#` symbol and end with a newline( NOT semicolon)
####  `#include`
- When you `#include` a file, the preprocessor replaces the `#include` directive with the contents of the included file
- For example the preprocessor will replace `#include <iostream>` with contents of the file named "iostream"
### Macro defines
- `#define` directives can be used to create a **macro**
- **macro (C++)** - rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text 
- Two types of macros:
	- Function-like macros
		- act like functions, and serve similar purpose. 
		- Their use is generally unsafe , and almost anything they can do can be done by a normal function
	- Object-like macros: can be defined in one of two ways:
``` cpp
#define IDENTIFIER
#befine IDENTIFIER substitution_text
```

- Top has no substitution text, because these are preprocessor directives, note that neither forms ends with a semicolon
- The identifier for a macro uses the same naming rules as normal identifiers
	- By convention, macro names are typically all uppercase, separated by underscores
#### Object-like macros with substitution text
- When the preprocessor encounters a directive, an association is made between the macro identifier and substitution_text. 
- All further occurrences of the macro identifier are replaced by the substitution_text
- Consider:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define MY_NAME "Alex"
int main()
{
    std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
- The preprocessor converts above into:
```cpp
int main()
{
    std::cout << "My name is: " << "Alex" << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
- Substitution text were used in C as a way to assign names to literals
- Best to avoid macros with substitution text unless no viable alternatives exist
#### Object-like macros without substitution text
Example:
``` cpp
#define USE_YEN
```
- In this case, the identifier is removed and replaced with nothing.
### Conditional compilation
- **Conditional compilation preprocessor directives** - Allow you to specify what conditions something will or won't compile. 
- most common: `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, and `#endif`
- `#ifdef` preprocessor directive allows the preprocessor to check whether an identifier has been previously defined via `#define`, if so, the code between the `#ifdef` and matching `#endif` is compiled. If not, the code is ignored
- `#ifndef` is the opposite of `#ifdef`
- Consider:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#define PRINT_JOE
int main()
{
#ifdef PRINT_JOE
    std::cout << "Joe\n"; // will be compiled since PRINT_JOE is defined
#endif
#ifdef PRINT_BOB
    std::cout << "Bob\n"; // will be excluded since PRINT_BOB is not defined
#endif
    return 0;
}
```

#### `#if 0`
- One more common use of condition compilation involves `#if 0` to exclude a block of code from being compiled and end with `endif`
- To temporarily re-enable, change to `#if 1`
### The scope of `#define`
- Consider:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
void foo()
{
#define MY_NAME "Alex"
}
int main()
{
	std::cout << "My name is: " << MY_NAME << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```
- The Preprocessor doesn't understand C++ concepts like function. Therefore, it behaves identically to if `#define MY_NAME "Alex"` is placed before or after the `foo` function
-  Once the preprocessor has finished, all defined identifiers from that file are discarded
	- Meaning directives are only valid from the point of definition to the end of the file in which they are defined
	- They don't impact other file
