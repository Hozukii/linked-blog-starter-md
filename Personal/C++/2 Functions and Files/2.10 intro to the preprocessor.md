- Prior to compilation, each code file goes through **preprocessing**
- A program called the **preprocessor** makes various changes to the text of the code file which either happen in either temporarily in-memory or using temporary files 
- **translation unit** - The result after the preprocessor has finished processing
### Preprocessor directives
- **Preprocessor directives** - instructions that start with a `#` symbol and end with a newline( NOT semicolon)
####  `#include`
- When you `#include` a file, the preprocessor replaces the `#include` directive with the contents of the included file
- For example the preprocessor will replace `#include <iostream>` with contents of the file named "iostream"
### Macro defines
- `#define` directives can be used to create a **macro**
- **macro (C++)** - rule that defines how input text is converted into replacement output text 
- Two types of macros:
	- Function-like macros
		- act like functions, and serve similar purpose. 
		- Their use is generally unsafe , and almost anything they can do can be done by a normal function
	- Object-like macros: can be defined in one of two ways:
``` cpp
#define IDENTIFIER
#befine IDENTIFIER substitution_text
```

- Top has no substitution text, because these are preprocessor directives, note that neither forms ends with a semicolon
- The identifier for a macro uses the same naming rules as normal identifiers
	- By convention, macro names are typically all uppercase, separated by underscores
#### Object-like macros with substitution text
