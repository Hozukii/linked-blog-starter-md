```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

- This program would give an error as it doesn't know what `add` is when it is called
### Solution
- Option 1: Reorder the function definitions
	- this option is not always possible. If we're writing two functions A and B. If A calls B , and function B calls A, then there's no way to order the function that will make the other happy. 
- Option 2: Use forward declaration
	- **Forward declaration** - tells the compiler about the existence of an identifier before actually defining the identifier 
	-
