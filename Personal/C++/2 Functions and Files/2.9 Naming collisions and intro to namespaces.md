- C++ requires that all identifier to be non-ambiguous. 
	- If there are 2 identical identifiers, the compiler can't tell them apart, leading to a **naming collision** error
- Most naming collisions occur in two cases:
	1. Two identically named functions are introduced in separate files leading to linker error
	2. Two identically named functions are introduced into the same file leading to compiler error
### Scope regions
- **Scope region** - area of source code where all declared identifiers are considered to be distinct from names declared in other scopes
	- Two identifiers can be declared in separate scope regions without conflict
### Namespaces 
- **Namespace** - Type of scope region that allows you to declare or define names inside of it for the purpose of disambiguation. 
- Namespaces may only contain declarations and definition. Executable statements are not allowed unless they are part of a definition
#### The global namespace
- **global namespace** - the outermost scope, where everything lives unless it's specifically put inside another namespace
