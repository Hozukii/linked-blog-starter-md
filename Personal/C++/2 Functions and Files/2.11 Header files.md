- Adding few forward declarations to the top of each file isn't too bad but as the code grows larger, doing it manually becomes tedious
### Header files
- C++ code files (.cpp) are not the only files commonly seen in C++ programs.
- The other type of file are called a **header file** (.h or .hpp or no extension at all)
- **header file** - Contain declarations and used to share code between different source files
### Using standard library header files
Consider 
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
```
- This program never provided a definition or declaration for `std::cout`, so how does the compiler know?
- `std::cout` has been forward declared in the "iostream" header file
### Using header files to propagate forward declarations
