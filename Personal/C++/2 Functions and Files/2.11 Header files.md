- Adding few forward declarations to the top of each file isn't too bad but as the code grows larger, doing it manually becomes tedious
### Header files
- C++ code files (.cpp) are not the only files commonly seen in C++ programs.
- The other type of file are called a **header file** (.h or .hpp or no extension at all)
- **header file** - Contain declarations and used to share code between different source files
### Using standard library header files
Consider 
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, world!";
	return 0;
}
```
- This program never provided a definition or declaration for `std::cout`, so how does the compiler know?
- `std::cout` has been forward declared in the "iostream" header file
### Using header files to propagate forward declarations
Consider two file `add.cpp` and `main.cpp`, a set up to compile them both would be:
`add.cpp`:
``` cpp
#include "add.h"
int add(int x, int y)
{
	return x + y;
}
```
`main.cpp`:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "add.h"
int add(int x, int y);
int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is" << add(3,4) << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
