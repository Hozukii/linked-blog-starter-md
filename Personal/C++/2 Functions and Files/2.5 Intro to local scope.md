### Local variables
- **Local variables** - Variables defined inside the body of a function
```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
	int z{x + y}; // z is a local variable
	return z;
}
```

- parameters `x` and `y` are also local variables
#### Local variable lifetime
- In [[1.3 Intro to objects and variables]], we discussed how variable definition such as `int x;`, causes the variable to be instantiated when this statement is executed. 
- Function parameters are created and initialized when the function is entered
- Variables within the function body are created and initialized at the point of definition
-  Local variables are destroyed in the opposite order of creation at the end of the set of curly braces in which it is defined 
``` cpp
int add(int x, int y) // x and y created and initialized here
{
	int z{x + y}; // z created and initialized here
	return z;
} // z, y, and x destroyed here
```

- When a object is destroyed, in most cases nothing happens
	- the destroyed object simply becomes invalid 
 - At some point after destruction, the memory used by the object will be deallocated
### Local scope (block scope)
- (An identifier's) **Scope** - Determines where the identifier can be seen and used within the source code.
- It's in scope when when an identifier can be seen and used
- Out of scope when an identifier can not be seen, we can not use it.
- The identifier of a local variable has local scope.
- An identifier with **local scope** is usable from the point of definition to the end of the innermost pair of curly braces containing the identifier
- Demonstrating the scope of a variable named `x`:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
// x is not in scope anywhere in this function
void doSomething()
{
	std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}
int main()
{
	// x can not be used here because it's not in scope yet
	int x{0}; // x enters scope here and can now be used within this function
	doSomething();
	return 0;
} // x goes out of scope
```
#### "out of scope" vs "going out of scope"
- An identifier is out of scope anywhere it cannot be accessed within the code
- "Going out of scope" is typically applied to objects rather than identifiers. 
	- we can say an object goes out of scope at the end of the scope
	-
