### Local variables
- **Local variables** - Variables defined inside the body of a function
```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
	int z{x + y}; // z is a local variable
	return z;
}
```

- parameters `x` and `y` are also local variables
#### Local variable lifetime
- In [[1.3 Intro to objects and variables]], we discussed how variable definition such as `int x;`, causes the variable to be instantiated when this statement is executed. 
- Function parameters are created and initialized when the function is entered
- Variables within the function body are created and initialized at the point of definition
-  Local variables are destroyed in the opposite order of creation at the end of the set of curly braces in which it is defined 
``` cpp
int add(int x, int y) // x and y created and initialized here
{
	int z{x + y}; // z created and initialized here
	return z;
} // z, y, and x destroyed here
```

- When a object is destroyed, in most cases nothing happens
	- the destroyed object simply becomes invalid 
 - At some point after destruction, the memory used by the object will be deallocated
### Local scope (block scope)
- (An identifier's) **Scope** - Determines where the identifier can be seen and used within the source code.
- It's in scope when when an identifier can be seen and used
- Out of scope when an identifier can not be seen, we can not use it.
- The identifier of a local variable has local scope.
- An identifier with **local scope** is usable from the point of definition to the end of the innermost pair of curly braces containing the identifier
- Demonstrating the scope of a variable named `x`:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
// x is not in scope anywhere in this function
void doSomething()
{
	std::cout << "Hello!\n";
}
int main()
{
	// x can not be used here because it's not in scope yet
	int x{0}; // x enters scope here and can now be used within this function
	doSomething();
	return 0;
} // x goes out of scope
```
#### "out of scope" vs "going out of scope"
- An identifier is out of scope anywhere it cannot be accessed within the code
- "Going out of scope" is typically applied to objects rather than identifiers. 
	- we can say an object goes out of scope at the end of the scope
### Functional separation
Consider the following program:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int add(int x, int y) // add's x and y are created and enter scope
{
	// add's x and y are visible within this funciton only
	return x + y;
} // add's x and y goes out of scope and destroyed here
int main()
{
	int x{5}; // main's x is created, initialized, and enters scope
	int y{6}; // main's y is created, initialized, and enters scope
	// main's x and y are usable within this function only
	std::cout << add(x,y) << '\n'; 
	return 0
} // main's y and x go out of scope and destroyed
```

- Neither `add` nor `main` know that the other function has variables with the same names. Because the scopes don't overlap, it's clear to the compiler which `x` and `y` are being referred to at any time
### Where to define local variables
- Best practice is that local variables inside the function body should be defined as close to their first use as reasonable:
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an Integer: ";
	int x{}; // x defined here
	std::cin >> x; // and used here

	std::cout << "Enter another Integer: ";
	int y{}; // y defined here
	std::cin >> y; // and used here
	int sum{ x + y}; //sum can be initialiezd with inteded value
	std::cout << "The sum is: " << sum << '\n';
	return 0;
}
```
#### When to use function parameters vs local variables
- A function parameter is used when the caller will pass in the initialization value as an argument
- Local variable should be used otherwise 
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int getValueFromUser(int val) // val is a function parameter
{
    std::cout << "Enter a value: ";
    std::cin >> val;
    return val;
}
int main()
{
    int x {};
    int num { getValueFromUser(x) }; // main must pass x as an argument
    std::cout << "You entered " << num << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```
- The value `x` is unnecessary
- So the correct way to write this is:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int getValueFromUser()
{
    int val {}; // val is a local variable
    std::cout << "Enter a value: ";
    std::cin >> val;
    return val;
}
int main()
{
    int num { getValueFromUser() }; // main does not need to pass anything
    std::cout << "You entered " << num << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

### Intro to temporary objects 
- **temporary object (anonymous object)** - unnamed object that is used to hold a value that is only needed for a short period of time
- Here is a common way a temporary value is created:
``` cpp
int getValueFromUser()
{
	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;
	return input; // return value of input back to the caller
}
int main()
{
	std::cout << getValueFromUser() << '/n'; // where does the returened value get stored?
	return 0;
}
```

- Since the the return value `input` is destroyed, as we haven't defined any variables in `main()`, the returned value is stored in a temporary object.
	- temporary objects have no scope
- Temporary objects are destroyed at the end of the full expression in which they are created: temp objects are always destroyed before the next statement executes
-
