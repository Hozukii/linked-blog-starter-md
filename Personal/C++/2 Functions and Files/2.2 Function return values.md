```cpp
// This program doesn't work
#include <iostream>

void getValueFromUser()
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;
}

int main()
{
	getValueFromUser(); // Ask user for input

	int num{}; // How do we get the value from getValueFromUser() and use it to initialize this variable?

	std::cout << num << " doubled is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

- This doesn't work as, when an integener is entered, the value tehy enter is lost when `getValueFromUser` terminates and control returns to `main`. variable `num` never gets initialized.
### Return values
First, your function has to indicate what type of value will be returned
- **Return types** - type of value a function gives back when it finishes
	- indicate what type of value will be returned
- **void** - no value will be returned to the caller
- This doesn't determine what specific value is returned - only what type
Second, what specific value is being returned
- **Return statement** - Indicate the specific value being returned to the caller
	- Consists of the `return` keyword, followed by an expression, ending in semi colon
- When return statement is executed
	- Return expression is evaluated to produce a value
	- The value produced by the return expression is copied back to caller(**return value**). 
	- The function exists, and control returns to caller
```cpp
#include <iostream>
// A return type of int means the function will return some integer value to the caller (the specific value is not specified here)
int returnFive()
{
    // the return statement provides the value that will be returned
    return 5; // return the value 5 back to the caller
}

int main()
{
    std::cout << returnFive() << '\n'; // prints 5
    std::cout << returnFive() + 2 << '\n'; // prints 7

    returnFive(); // okay: the value 5 is returned, but is ignored since main() doesn't do anything with it

    return 0;
}
```

### Fixed original program 
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int getValueFromUser() // this function now returns an integer value
{
 	std::cout << "Enter an integer: ";
	int input{};
	std::cin >> input;

	return input; // return the value the user entered back to the caller
}

int main()
{
	int num { getValueFromUser() }; // initialize num with the return value of getValueFromUser()

	std::cout << num << " doubled is: " << num * 2 << '\n';

	return 0;
}
```

### Revisiting main()
- In C++ there are two special requirements for `main()`
	- It's required to return an `int` (usually `return 0`)
- Explicit functions to call main() are disallowed
#### Status codes
- **Status code** - used to signal whether your program was successful or not
- by convention a status code of `0` mean the program ran normally
---
- A value-returning function that does not return a value will produce undefined behaviour
		- **Value-returning function** - Function that returns a value
		- Anything return type other than `void` is a value-returning function
---
- function main will implicitly return 0 if not statement is provided 
	- It's best practice to explicitly return 
---
#### The function author can decide what the return value means
- Some return values as status codes
- other function return a calculated or selected value
- other functions return nothing
### Reusing functions
- **DRY** - Don't repeat yourself
- Repeating is bad because there would be a lot of redundant code, and a lot of room for typos to creep in
- DRY is a guideline not an absolute
-
