### Why use functions
- Organization - A function is almost like mini programs. It allows you to write separately from the main program without thinking about the rest
- Reusability - "Don't repeat yourself"
- Testing - Functions reduce code redundancy and less testing required
- Extensibility - functions allow us to make the change in one place and have that change take effect every time the function is called
- Abstraction - you only need to know its name, inputs , outputs, and where it lives. You don't need to know how it works
### Effectively using functions
- If it repeats, it should generally made into a function
- Code that has a well-defined set of inputs and outputs is a good candidate for a function. 
- Function should generally perform one task
- If a function becomes too long, too complicated, or hand to understand, it can be split into multiple sub-functions
