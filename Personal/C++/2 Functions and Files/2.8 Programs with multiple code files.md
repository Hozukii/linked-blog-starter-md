- Best to given them a .cpp extention when adding new code files to your projects
### A multi-file example
Take example with file: `add.cpp` and `main.cpp`
add.cpp:
```cpp
int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
```

main.cpp:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n'; // compile error
    return 0;
}
```

- This will fail to compile as `main.cpp` doesn't know what identifier add is
- It compiles each file individual, it doesn't know the content of other files
- This limited visibility and short memory is due to:
	- Allow source code to be compiled in any order
	- When we change a source file, only that source file needs to be recompiled
	- It reduces the possibility of naming conflicts between identifier in different files
- To fix use a forward declaration:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int add(int x, int y); // needed so main.cpp knows that add() is a function defined elsewhere

int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is: " << add(3, 4) << '\n';
    return 0;
```

### Something went wrong!
1. If you get a compiler error about `add` not being defined in `main`, you probably forgot the forward declaration function 
2. if you get a linker error about `add` 
	1. most likely, `add.cpp` is nod added to your project correctly
	2. possible that you added `add.cpp` in the wrong project
	3. possible that the file is set to not compile or link
