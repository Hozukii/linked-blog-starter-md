- **iostream** - input/output library
``` cpp
#include <iostream>
```

#### Std::cout
- send data to console
``` cpp
	std::cout << "Hello" << " world!";
```
- `<<` **insertion operator** 
- It can also be used to print multiple in singe line
- `std::endl` - allows te output onto a new line
``` cpp
   std::cout << "Hi!" << std::endl; 
   // std::endl will cause the cursor to move to the next line
    std::cout << "My name is Alex." << std::endl;
```
- It's best to output a new line whenever a output is complete even when it's not technically necessary
#### `std::cout` is buffered
