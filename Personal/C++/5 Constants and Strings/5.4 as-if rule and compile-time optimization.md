### as-if rule
- **as-if rule** - In C++, the compiler is able to optimize however it like as long as the "observable behaviour" does not change
#### Constant folding
- **Constant folding** - Optimization technique where the literal operand is replaced with the result because the variables of the operands are constant
	- e.g. `3+4` is replaced with `7`
#### Constant propagation
- **Constant propagation** - A optimization technique where a compiler replaces known variables with constant values with their value
- Example:  `x` is replaced with `7`
```cpp
	int x { 7 };
	std::cout << x << '\n';
```

#### Dead code elimination
- **Dead code elimination** - Optimization technique where lines of code are removed that may have no effect on the program's behaviour
