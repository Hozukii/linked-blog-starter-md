### Intro to constants
- **constant** - value that may not be changed during the program's execution
- C++ supports 2 types
	- **named constants** - constant values that are associated with an identifier
		- Also called symbolic constants
	- **Literal constants** - constant values that are not associated with a identifier
#### Types of named constants
- 3 ways to define a named constant in C++:
	- Constant variables
	- Object-like macros with substitution text
		- [[2.10 intro to the preprocessor]]
	- Enumerated constants
		- [[13.2 Unscoped enumerations]]
### Constant variables
#### Declaring a const variable
- we place the `const` keyword adjacent to the object's type:
``` cpp
const double gravity {9.8} // preferred
int const sideInsquare {4} 
```

### `Const` variables must be initialized
- `const` variables must be initialized when you define them
- Note that `const` variables can be initialized from other variables (including non-const ones)
###  `Const` function parameters
- Don't use `const` for value parameters
### `const` return values
- Don't use `const` when retuning by value
### Why variables should be made constant
- It reduces the chance of bugs
- It provides more opportunity for the compiler to optimize programs
- Most importantly, it reduces the complexity of our programs
### Object-like macros with substitution text
- Covered in [[2.10 intro to the preprocessor]]
- Prefer constant variables over ojbect-like macros with substitution text
	- As macros don't have normal scoping rules
