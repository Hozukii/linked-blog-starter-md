### Intro to constants
- **constant** - value that may not be changed during the program's execution
- C++ supports 2 types
	- **named constants** - constant values that are associated with an identifier
		- Also called symbolic constants
	- **Literal constants** - constant values that are not associated with a identifier
#### Types of named constants
- 3 ways to define a named constant in C++:
	- Constant variables
	- Object-like macros with substitution text
		- [[2.10 intro to the preprocessor]]
	- Enumerated constants
		- [[13.2 Unscoped enumerations]]
