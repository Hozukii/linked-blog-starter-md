- **Literals** - values that are inserted directly into the code
- Example:
```cpp
return 5;                     // 5 is an integer literal
bool myNameIsAlex { true };   // true is a boolean literal
double d { 3.4 };             // 3.4 is a double literal
std::cout << "Hello, world!"; // "Hello, world!" is a C-style string literal
```
### The type of a literal
![[Pasted image 20250628202949.png]]
### Literal suffixes
- If the default type is not desired, you can add suffix to change the types
- Common suffixes:

### Suffix casing
- Most suffixes are not case sensitive
- Exceptions:
	- `s` and `sv` must be lower case
	- Two consecutive `l` or `L` characters must have the same casing (`lL` and `Ll` are not accepted) 
- Prefer `L` over lower case `l` as it's hard to tell
### Floating point literals
- floating point literals are type of `double` by default
	- To change use suffix `f` to change to `float`
- Be careful that this leads to an error:
``` cpp
float f {4.1}
```
- You must specify that `4.1` is a float by doing `4.1f`
#### Scientific notation for floating point literals
- use suffix `e`
``` cpp
double avogadro { 6.02e23 }; // 6.02 x 10^23 is a double literal in scientific notation
double protonCharge { 1.6e-19 }; // charge on a proton is 1.6 x 10^-19
```

### String literals
- Strings are not a fundamental type in C++
- It's a strange, complicated type that is hard to work with
- Such strings are often call C strings or C-style strings 
	- From the C language
- Two non-obvious thing about C-style strings
1. All C-style stirgs have a implicit null terminator 
	- Take `"Hello"`. It only appoars to have 5 characters but it actually have six
	- `'h'`, `'e'`, `'l'`, `'l'`, `'o'`,`'\0'`
	- `\0` - **null terminator** - used to indicate the end of a string
2. Unlike most other literals, C-style string literals are constant objects 
### Magic numbers
- **Magic number** - literal that either has an unclear meaning or may need to be changed later
- Avoid it
