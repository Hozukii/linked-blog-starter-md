I was doing SLT until about January but after the leaders changed and the we started to get really busy with IB. 

With the SLT, I liked doing the work and collaborating with other people was fun but I just couldn't spend hours every month. It just wasn't my priority. Also, although collaborating is really fun, sometimes it came with a lot of back-and-forth discussions which slowed things down a bit. I realised that while I enjoy working with others and exchanging ideas, I prefer more hands-on or task-oriented roles rather than long meetings or decision-making sessions that span several weeks.


Being ppart prat of SLT, I really realized how important organization is. I personally didn't have to deal with it too much since, I specifically chose to do the roles where I didn't need to be the organizing the team.  hile I didnâ€™t always have the time to be super involved, I still appreciated the opportunity to be part of the conversations and support where I could. I contributed in small but meaningful ways, whether that was sharing ideas, helping during events, or giving feedback when decisions were being made.
Overall, even if I wasn't the most involved member time-wise, in the last months,  I still took something away from the experience. I think that I like working in a bit smaller groups maybe 3 to 4 because when there are too many people trying to make decisions not a lot gets done relative to how many people are working on it.
