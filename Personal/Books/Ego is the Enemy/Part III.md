No one is permanently successful  and not everyone finds success on the first attempt. We all deal with setbacks along the way. Ego leaves us unprepared for those moments but also keeps us there.
- We can do everything right and end up in shit
- Rely on your own metrics of success while everyone else is occupied by a supposed external measures of weakness and success
# ALIVE TIME OR DEAD TIME?
- According to Robert Greene, there are two types of time. 
	- Dead time:  when people are passive and waiting 
	- Alive time: When people are learning and acting and utilizing every second.
- Every moment of failure, every moment or situation presents this choice.: Alive time. Dead time. 
- Think of what you have been putting off. Issues you declined to deal with. Systemic problems that felt too overwhelming to address
- When we fail and lack the ability to examine ourselves, we reinvest our energy into exactly the patters of behaivour that caused our problems to begin with. 
- Make use of what's around you **Don't let stubbornness make a bad situation worse**
# THE EFFORT IS ENOUGH
- What matters to an active man is to do the right thing: whether the right thing comes to pass should not bother him. 
- Less attached we are to outcomes the better. When fulfilling our own standard s is what fills us with pride and self-respect. 
# DRAW THE LINE 
- When our identity is tied up in our work. We worry that any kind of failure will then say something bad about us as a person. It's a fear of taking responsibility, of admitting that we might have messed up. 
- When we find ourselves in such failures. Have the courage to make a **full stop.** 
	- It doesn't mean to give up everything after a bit of obstacles. It's the power to recognize the bigger picture. When a boxer knows to tap out since if he keeps going, he might not be able to fight for the rest of his career. 
- Understand that positions are transitory, not statements about your value as a human being. 
- Seneca said: "He who fears death will never do anything worthy of a living man"
	- Alter that: He who will do anything to avoid failure will almost certainly do something worthy of a failure
- If your reputation can't absorb a few blows, it wasn't worth anything in the first place
- Even in times of success : you're not as good as you think . You don't have everything figured out. Stay focused, Do better.
