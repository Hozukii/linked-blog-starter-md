# Part 1
### summary
Plato, through a story about Socrates, tries to answer the question of "What is just or right?" Cephalus claims justice is paying ones dues and truthfulness. Socrates argues that paying ones dues to a person who has gone mad is not just. Polemarchus then suggests justice is benefiting one's friends and harming his enemies. However, Socrates says it's hard to know who are your foes and enemies. In addition he argues that a just person will not harm anyone. Because a good man will not use his goodness to make others bad. Thrasymachus suggest that right is the "interest of the stronger".  But the strongest makes mistakes and does things in not in his interest at times. Then he also brings up that no just ruler will rule for his sake but the sake of others just like how doctors care for the sake of the patient and the pilot drives in the sake of his crews. 
Does the just live better and happier than the unjust?
Function - something one can only do, or does best, with the thing sin question
If something is deprived of its excellence(arete) then it will function badly. Socrates then argues that concentration, controlling oneself, and **life** is a function of the mind. So the just mind will have a good life, and the unjust man would have a bad life.
