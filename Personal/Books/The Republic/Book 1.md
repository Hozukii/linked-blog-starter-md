# Part 1
### summary
Plato, through a story about Socrates, tries to answer the question of "What is just or right?" Cephalus claims justice is paying ones dues and truthfulness. Socrates argues that paying ones dues to a person who has gone mad is not just. Polemarchus then suggests justice is benefiting one's friends and harming his enemies. However, Socrates says it's hard to know who are your foes and enemies. In addition he argues that a just person will not harm anyone. Because a good man will not use his goodness to make others bad. Thrasymachus suggest that right is the "interest of the stronger".
