- The imagined order is an idea created by humans. Such as racism or human rights
- These ideas only exist in the mind of humanity and is not a natural law. 
- Imagined order is [[inter-subjective]].
- They are only orders of the humans that believe them. If no one believed in the order, the order would cease to have power or exist. 
- I think that money can also be seen as an imagined order.
