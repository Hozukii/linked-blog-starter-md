## introduction
The book is series of notes written by Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. This book was never meant to be published to the world yet this is one of the most famous books when it comes to stoicism. It baffles me how many problems he had are so relatable even if it was written 2000 years ago by one of the most successful and powerful man in history. 

## How has it helped me
 - The book has helped me to bring more purpose in life
 - The book has helped to try to think a bit more before I say anything
 - The book has shown me the importance of myself and how I should treat myself with respect and kindness just like I would other people. 
## Final Impressions
Definitely a interesting book that I could recommend to people. Many ideas were surprising that they have stood the test of time. Although the book was written 2000 years ago, many teaching still apply to this day in age. I am very glad that I have picked up this book and itâ€™s a really good self-help book. Many of the topics which I tend to focus on was about purpose and way of controlling your mind.
