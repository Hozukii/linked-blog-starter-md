# Importance of Recall
- A common technique for learning is reading the textbook again but recall is a better and easier method. 
- Look away and see what you can recall from the material you've just read 
- The retrieval process helps to build new chunks
# Illusions of competence
- Merely glancing at a solution and thinking you truly know it yourself is one of the most common illusion of competence. You've done almost nothing for your own underlying neural circuitry. You must have the information persisting in your memory to master it. 
- Highlighting and underlying must be done carefully. 
	- Try to keep highlighting to a minimum. 
	- On the other hand, words or notes in a margin that synthesize key concepts are a good idea. 
- Wanting to learn the material and spending a lot of time with it, doesn't guarantee you'll actually learn it.
- To make sure you are learning and not in an illusion of competence is test yourself on whatever you're learning. 
	- Recall is actually what this is. Making sure you have learned.
	- Mistakes help correct your thinking, so that you can learn better and do better. 
- It might also help to learn a new subject in a new environment. 
	- When you are learning something new, you can often take subliminal cues from the space around at the time you are first learning. 
- By learning in different spaces, you will be independent from the environment and will be able to perform in different environments.
