- Compact packages of information that our mind can easily access 
# What is a chunk?
- Chunking is the mental leap that helps unite bits of information together through meaning 
	- The new understanding the in logical connection of information allows the brain to remember easier and easier to fit the chunks into the large picture of what you're learning
- Just remembering the fact doesn't allow you to understand the concept. 
	- There is no interlocking
- Focusing on connecting ideas together is an important part of the [[focused mode]] of learning 
- When you are stressed, it loses the ability to make some of those connections 
- **Example** - The  letters P , O , P interlinks to make the word Pop much easier to remember because the letters are bound together through meaning
- Chunks are basically a network of neurons that are used to firing together so you can think a thought or perform an action smoothly and effectively
- Focused practice and repetition helps you to create chunks
# How to form a chunk 
- You find patterns in things you are trying to learn. 
- You have little bits of pieces of information / skill that you have learned and you connect them to larger and more complex chunks
- The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained that you don't even have to think about connecting the neural patterns together. 
- **Example**:
	- Language learning: in the beginning, often just saying a single word with right tone, accent involves a lot of practice. Stringing sentences together involves the ability to creatively connect smaller chunks to create a coherent sentence
	- math and science involves the same approach. They might first give you a worked solution. Your job is to find out why they took the steps to solve the question. You are finding patterns. 
- Mental and physical learning have similarities but does not have the exact same approach to chunking
1. Focus your undivided attention on the information that you want to chunk
2. Understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk 
	- If you don't understand, you can create a chunk but that chunk will be useless and will not fit in with the other materials you are trying to learn 
	- Understanding does not necessarily create a chunk that you can easily recall
3. Practice and try to do it yourself. 
	- Listening to a song will not give you the expertise to sing the same song, you must practice singing
	- Just because you understand it or see it doesn't means you can do it yourself
4. Gaining context
	- Not just how but also when to use this chunk
	- Going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly
	- Using it with related and unrelated problems to see when but also when not to use
	- 

- Ultimately, Practice allows the connection to broaden not only ensuring that the idea is firm but also accessible from many different paths
- Looking through a textbook briefly before starting it can allow the brain to have a bigger picture.
	- It helps to understanding where the chunks fit in the whole picture
- Start with the main and big ideas and fill in the details next
